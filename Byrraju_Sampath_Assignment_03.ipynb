However, \"Dune: Part Two\" not only meets this elusive challenge but soars beyond, delivering a cinematic experience that is as colossal in its narrative ambition as it is in its visual spectacle.Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's seminal work continues with a narrative that is both expansive and intimate, weaving a tale that is as much about the vastness of the universe as it is about the intricacies of human emotion and power. The film picks up seamlessly from where the first installment left off, plunging the audience back into the arid yet awe-inspiring landscapes of Arrakis1.The story's hero, Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), is now fully entrenched in the world of the Fremen, the indigenous people of Arrakis. His journey from a naive young duke to a leader hardened by the realities of interstellar politics and war is portrayed with a sensitivity that belies the epic backdrop against which his story unfolds. Chalamet's performance is nuanced, capturing the internal struggle of a man caught between destiny and desire2.Rebecca Ferguson returns as Lady Jessica, whose strength and complexity are given even more room to shine in this sequel. Her portrayal of a mother and a political powerhouse is compelling, adding layers to a character that could easily have been overshadowed by the grandiose setting and plot1.The film's antagonist, House Harkonnen, is depicted with a grotesque opulence that is both repelling and fascinating. Stellan Skarsgard's Baron Harkonnen is a figure of nightmarish tyranny, his presence on screen as commanding as it is chilling2.Villeneuve's direction is masterful, balancing the intimate moments of character development with breathtaking set pieces that showcase the film's staggering budget and technical prowess. The battle scenes are a particular highlight, with the director's use of scale and perspective creating a sense of immersion that is rarely achieved in cinema1.The cinematography is nothing short of revolutionary. Each frame is a painting, a carefully crafted composition of light and shadow that brings the alien world of Arrakis to life. The use of color, from the deep blues of the Fremen eyes to the golden sands of the desert, is deliberate and evocative2.The score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is a character in its own right. It is both haunting and heroic, underscoring the film's themes of legacy, loss, and the relentless pursuit of power. The music elevates the visual storytelling, creating an atmosphere that is immersive and emotionally resonant1.\"Dune: Part Two\" is not without its flaws. The pacing, while mostly deliberate, occasionally falters, and some may find the film's adherence to the source material a hindrance to its narrative momentum. However, these are minor quibbles in what is otherwise a triumph of science fiction filmmaking2.In conclusion, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a monumental achievement. It is a film that demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible, not just for the sheer scale of its visual ambition but for the depth of its storytelling.

            "Document 975 (Score: 0.0713): \"Dune: Part Two\" invites audiences into a mesmerizing narrative universe, mixing the stories of love, revenge, and fate of the main protagonist, Paul Atreides. The film emerged not just as a sequel but as an immersive cinematic experience, marrying the incredible visual and deep narrative. The opening scenes alone show the grandeur element of the movie where the vastness of the desert is captured in wide shots and breathtaking cinematography.The combination of the talented Denis Villeneuve as the director and Greig Fraser as the cinematographer becomes apparent and results in a visual masterpiece. The imagery is not just a backdrop but a character in its own right, shaping the emotional landscape of the film. One standout scene unfolds when Paul Atreides, played by the exceptional Timotthe Chalamet, confronts the ruins of his ancestral home. That scene alone serves as a poignant visual metaphor for the shattered remains of the legacy that his family built for decades. Chalamet has proven himself to be an actor with depth and serious talent that transcends across the big screen. Chalamet masterfully navigates his character's journey from vulnerability to a determination to reclaim what was lost, setting the tone for the overarching themes of resilience and revenge.The narration of religion becomes palpable in a pivotal scene where Paul grapples with prophetic visions. The sequence masterfully blends visual effects with Hans Zimmer's haunting and captivating score which creates an atmosphere that is fueled with mysticism. The film effectively balances organized religion with an exploration of mystical elements embedded in Frank Herbert's material. One of the film's most visually arresting moments occurs during a Fremen sandworm hunt. The usage of CGI effects is a testament to the film's commitment to pushing the boundaries of visual storytelling. As the movie progresses and the characters navigate through the desert terrain, each frame not only showcases the film's technical achievement but also propels the narrative forward, underscoring the symbiotic relationship between spectacle and powerful storytelling.One of the highlights of the movie is Rebecca Ferguson's portrayal of Lady Jessica which contributes a layer of complexity to the story. In one particular scene where she imparts wisdom to Paul, Ferguson infuses the character with such maternal gravity that adds layers and depth to their relationship. Her nuanced performance coupled with the rich character development, anchor the film in emotional authenticity. Javier Bardem and Dave Bautista also deliver a memorable performance as Stilgar and Rabban, respectively. In a scene where Stilgar confronts Paul about his intentions with the Fremen, Bardem's commanding presence underscores the tension between the native inhabitants and the newcomers. Bautista's Rabban, a brutal enforcer, exudes menace, creating a palpable sense of threat that permeates the narrative.Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Josh Brolin, and Charlotte Rampling, contributed to the film's complex story. With their performances that are convincing and commanding, some scenes featuring their characters added layers to the story which resulted in a web of relationships that enriches the narrative.The richness of the movie's theme extends to a sequence that explores the balance of romance and broader narrative. As Paul and Chani, played wonderfully by Zendaya, unfold and navigate through their relationship, explore the film's complexities of love amidst a backdrop of political intrigue and impending war. The romance, initially presented as the focal, seamlessly marries with the overarching themes of religion and fate.The culmination of these narrative threads is evident in climactic battle scenes that pit Fremen against formidable adversaries. The scene choreography of the action sequences, accompanied by the film's impeccable visuals, results in a visceral and intense cinematic experience. The stakes are high, and the film successfully maintains tension without sacrificing its commitment to visual grandeur. The combination of visuals and storytelling is perhaps the most evident in a scene where Paul faces a moral dilemma. The interplay of light and shadow, coupled with Zimmer's evocative score, added the emotional weight of the moment. The film's ability to balance spectacle with substance underscores its place not only as a visual feast but also as a powerhouse in storytelling.As the film progresses, the story embraces the philosophical underpinnings of Herbert's source material. In a scene where Paul contemplates his role as a potential messiah, the film delves into questions of destiny, free will, and the consequences of wielding immense power. This exploration adds intellectual depth to the narrative, inviting audiences to ponder the implications of Paul's journey. The film's final act also delivers a direct resolution that is both satisfying and open-ended. As Paul fights with the consequences of his choices, the movie leaves room for contemplation. In a scene where Paul confronts the complexities of leadership, Timothee Chalamet's performance captures the weight of his character's innate responsibility.In conclusion, \"Dune: Part Two\" transcends the confines of traditional sequels, standing as a testament to the potential of cinema as an art form. The marriage of breathtaking visuals, masterful storytelling, and nuanced performances creates a cinematic experience that resonates on multiple levels. The film's exploration of love, revenge, religion, and destiny unfolds within a visual landscape that is as captivating as it is thought-provoking. Denis Villeneuve's magnum opus, \"Dune: Part Two\" sets a new standard for cinematic excellence, leaving an enduring legacy in the annals of film history.\n",

Building upon the foundation laid in the first installment, this sequel delves even deeper into the political intrigue, religious undertones, and philosophical complexities that define the Dune universe. Director Denis Villeneuve masterfully navigates the narrative, seamlessly blending stunning visuals with profound storytelling. The desert landscapes of Arrakis are as awe-inspiring as ever, evoking a sense of both beauty and danger. Timothée Chalamet reprises his role as Paul Atreides, delivering a nuanced performance that captures the character's inner conflict and burgeoning power. The ensemble cast, including Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, and Oscar Isaac, each shine in their respective roles, adding depth and dimension to the story. One of the standout aspects of the movie is its exploration of the mystical elements introduced in the first film. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood and their manipulation of bloodlines, the prophetic visions of the Fremen, and the enigmatic nature of the sandworms all contribute to the rich tapestry of the Dune universe. The film also delves deeper into the themes of destiny, sacrifice, and the consequences of wielding power. As Paul Atreides grapples with his newfound abilities and the weight of his family's legacy, he is forced to confront difficult choices that will shape the fate of the galaxy. Villeneuve's direction is both grandiose and intimate, capturing the epic scale of the story while also delving into the personal struggles of its characters. The action sequences are pulse-pounding and visually stunning, but it is the quieter moments of introspection and dialogue that truly resonate. Hans Zimmer's score once again elevates the film, immersing the audience in the world of Dune with its haunting melodies and epic orchestration. Overall, this movie is a triumph of storytelling and spectacle, a worthy continuation of the beloved saga that will leave audiences eagerly awaiting the next chapter.

There were fun moments for sure, but to me, the overall story arc, the pacing, the character development - most of it fell flat. There was really no character I could care about or root for.

The protagonist's mother is written as incredibly annoying, the villains are underused, Florence Pugh's character has 0 likability and acts simply as a story device. Bardem's character is OK and funny at times and Brolin doesn't have a standout moment. Zendaya's character is the sole exception to this, who is the beating heart of the film.At times, I also felt that Chalamet, despite being an amazing actor, is perhaps miscast, though having not read the material, I cannot comment further on this.The pacing felt off, as it stays too long in places it shouldn't, while sacrificing moments that could linger longer. This coming from a person that enjoys long epics and slow burn films. The movie looks outstanding though feels closer to a connection of rushed story beats. The direction it takes with the main character also does not feel earned.Perhaps the second biggest issue is that I do not totally buy into the world that has been created. It feels large but empty and lacking character. Almost too clean and strange for the sake of it. Style over substance. We stay for most of the time in one or two places which doesn't help. There were also some weird choice of cuts and jumps in scenes that hampered the flow of the film.With that said, there are a couple of epic moments that stood out, which are 1) the whole Zendaya bazooka scene and 2) the giant worm riding.Overall, the film is enjoyable. However without engaging characters, a believable world, and pacing issues, the film falls short of greatness, perhaps way short.\n",

There are a bunch of fanboys out there who will fall drooling to the ground when they see a large scale CG battle in a scifi movie. They don't care if there is a plot or character development. Just seeing the pew pews will get them going.This is a good movie and it owes its strength to its incredible predecessor. But in the second installment lost are the sound design, the strong undercurrent of character buildup and the pace that got the viewer in - that made you \"live\" the movie. Villeneuve, having spent 3 hours in Dune:Part 1 building up an entire universe with dazzling believability suddenly rushes through the whole Part 2 to obviously pave the way to a new set of sequels.There is a hectic feeling to the flow of the plot. Villeneuve acts as if he is eager to get to the end. It is a great show-off and you can sense the pride he has in his creation.Character development is lost here. While he allows the young Atreides to mature a little and discover himself, he quickly turns Stilgar into an almost comical, caricaturized fanatic. While trying to enrich the universe with some new players he wastes the good old ones unnecessarily.The visual design is beautiful to behold as ever. May be it is because we have somewhat gotten familiar with them, the impact is less but still there.The sound was one of the strongest aspects of Part 1. Somehow I feel as if it is sacrificed here to make room for more dialogue. And I think it is a great loss.Conclusion to my rant: By any standard this is a good movie. Worthy of a glowing 7 or 7.5 score. However compared to what it could have been, it unfortunately falls short. And it definitely does not deserve a 9.\n",

Villeneuve continues to employ outstanding special effects and meticulously crafted sets that fully immerse the audience in the world of \"Dune.\"Hans Zimmer's score once again provides an impressive musical backdrop that perfectly complements the film's mood. The music enhances the emotional depth of the scenes, creating an atmospheric richness that captivates the viewer. Zimmer's powerful and evocative soundtrack significantly contributes to the film's epic feel.The performances are consistently strong. Timothée Chalamet portrays Paul Atreides with a blend of vulnerability and resolve, making his journey as a rising leader believable. Rebecca Ferguson shines as Lady Jessica, while Zendaya takes on a more prominent role as Chani, with her chemistry with Chalamet being notably palpable. Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Harkonnen and Javier Bardem as Stilgar bring necessary depth and intensity to their roles.However, a notable critique is the film's occasional sluggishness. While the detailed portrayal of the world and character development is appreciated, the narrative sometimes drags. Some scenes feel extended and could have benefited from tighter editing to maintain a brisker pace. This languid pacing can occasionally pull the viewer out of the story and diminish the suspense.Overall, the film is an immensely powerful continuation that impresses both visually and audibly. Hans Zimmer's music and the strong performances contribute significantly to the film's atmosphere. Despite the episodic slow spots, which can make the viewing experience somewhat taxing, the film remains essential for fans of the first part and the science fiction genre who are ready to engage in a profound and visually opulent adventure.\n",

With the camera mainly focusing on far and wide shots in the dense and humid environment of the dunes, rushes of adrenaline will hit you hard as you watch the sequences unfold in the opening scenes. The director, Denis Villeneuve, stepped up his game from the first film to truly capture the movement and living qualities of the characters in the desert.The film doesn't waste your time by reintroducing everything but rather expects you to know what happened previously as this is basically their version of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK within the soon to be trilogy. The main subject that stood out to me throughout the film was character growth. Most characters go through change or experience changes around them, some more than others, further enhancing their capabilities and raising the bar for how far they reached to achieve their goals. The character that I thought experienced the most changes was Paul Atreides.Paul Atriedes slowly made his way up the ladder, from doubting himself for following in his father's footsteps, to coming to his own terms and realizing the true potential he has. By breaking away from his original idea of being his father's predecessor, Paul now realizes that he can do so much more. Paul's growth from the first film to this one was immense and important. Once a self-judging and insecure person to someone who has everyone looking up to him, not just as a leader but a savior, is noteworthy in and of itself. With every good leader or religious figure there is always one downside or trait that follows them and for Paul, it's his desperate hunger for power. The further he goes on the path he's following, for everything good he's committing to, he slowly loses himself in a power hungry struggle.Florence Pugh's performance in the film, although quite small, is all encompassing, as it should be since she is the daughter of the emperor after all. Pugh gives off a strong sense of empowerment that I think the emperor, played by Christopher Walken, didn't quite have on screen. Having a high status on her shoulders, she also carried the slightest hint of worry, never knowing what could happen between her father and her people. She also brings a lot of emotional weight when it comes to her facial expressions as she's able to say so much without speaking. From the shock she gives off to the short but sweet smiles, it all makes for a more dramatic but beautiful look for the film.Austin Butler's performance in the film is quite a suspenseful one. Not only is he another new addition to the already large list of characters, he brings a vibe like no other. When we first meet his character, the color grading changes from vibrant and bright to a black and white scheme, giving off a sinister look to his character and many others. I previously mentioned facial expressions and how Florence Pugh did an excellent job yet it is Austin Butler, however who takes it above and beyond everyone's expectations. The way he brought some of his sinister expressions had the same effect as Azog did from THE HOBBIT trilogy of films, especially when he was a fully CG rendered character. I personally think he outperformed Dave Bautista and Stellan Skarsgard, who were in the same boat as him, playing another role as members of the family.Timothee Chalamet's performance in this film is a far step ahead from where he was originally in the first film, truly showing what he's capable of as an actor and this is most evident towards the later acts of the film. Chalamet brings a lot of charm to the role as Paul, allowing the audience to connect with him as he taps into a leadership role which the audience may be able to relate to if they have had to be a leader in their lives. Chalamet takes the emotional status that Paul has from the first film to a whole new level in this second film. Having previously had more of a laid back focus to his character, even though he's the heart of both films, he pushed the limits this time as he breaks that barrier and becomes the leader he was meant to be.At the end of the day, DUNE: PART TWO is a phenomenal piece of cinema that we don't get all that often. To see this film on the big screen, even if it's not on IMAX, is still a beauty of a film to look at, thanks to Greig Fraser, the cinematographer. Would I recommend this film to the general audience? No, as it is a slow burner, mainly focusing on heavy character development, but when it comes to pure film lovers, this shouldn't be overlooked.\n",

These moments, while beautiful, can feel a bit too drawn out and risk losing the audience's attention. It's a film that demands patience, and not everyone will appreciate this slow-burn approach. The plot itself remains dense and complex, staying true to the novel. For fans of the book, it's a joy to see such a faithful adaptation. However, for those who aren't familiar with the source material, the story can be confusing and hard to follow. There are many characters, political factions, and subplots to keep track of, and the film doesn't always make it easy to understand what's going on. A bit more exposition or simplification could have gone a long way in making the film more accessible to a broader audience.Another area where the film falls short is in its emotional resonance. While the performances are strong, there's a certain coldness to the story. The epic scope and the focus on political intrigue sometimes overshadow the personal, human elements. I found myself appreciating the film intellectually more than emotionally. It's a grand, impressive spectacle, but it doesn't always connect on a deeper, more personal level. The action scenes, when they come, are thrilling and well-executed. The battles are intense, and the use of practical effects combined with CGI creates a believable and immersive experience. The Sandworms, iconic to the Dune universe, are particularly well done, evoking both awe and terror. Hans Zimmer's score deserves a special mention. His music elevates the film to another level, adding a haunting, otherworldly quality that perfectly matches the tone and scale of the story. It's powerful and evocative, enhancing the impact of the visual storytelling.In conclusion, DUNE PART 2, is a visually stunning and ambitious film that stays true to its source material. It offers strong performances, particularly from Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, and creates an immersive world that is a joy to get lost in. However, its slow pacing, complex plot, and emotional detachment can make it a challenging watch. Fans of the first film and the book will likely appreciate it, but it may not resonate as strongly with a broader audience. It's a film that demands patience and attention, rewarding those who are willing to dive deep into its intricate world, but potentially alienating those looking for a more straightforward or emotionally engaging experience.\n",

While the epic scale of the story is undeniably awe-inspiring, it is the human drama at its core that truly resonates. Themes of identity, loyalty, and sacrifice are explored with nuance and depth, inviting audiences to ponder the complexities of power and the nature of destiny.Hans Zimmer's haunting score once again elevates the film, perfectly complementing the grandeur and emotion of the narrative.

As the power struggles between the noble houses intensify and the specter of war looms ever larger, the film navigates the murky waters of ambition and betrayal with deft precision.One of the film's most striking aspects is its attention to detail, both in its world-building and character development. From the intricacies of Fremen culture to the Machiavellian machinations of the various factions vying for control of Arrakis, every aspect of Herbert's universe is brought to vivid life on the screen. Each character, no matter how minor, feels fully realized, with their own motivations and desires driving the narrative forward.The cinematography, once again, deserves special mention for its ability to capture the otherworldly beauty of Arrakis while also conveying the harsh realities of life on the desert planet. From the towering sand dunes to the windswept sietches of the Fremen, every frame is a visual feast for the eyes, immersing viewers in a world that is at once alien and familiar.At the heart of the film lies the character of Paul Atreides, whose journey from reluctant heir to messianic figure is at once epic and deeply personal. Timothée Chalamet's portrayal is nothing short of mesmerizing, capturing the internal struggle and external pressures that define Paul's transformation with remarkable nuance and subtlety.The supporting cast, too, deserves praise for their performances, with each actor bringing their own unique talents to their respective roles. From Oscar Isaac's stoic portrayal of Duke Leto Atreides to Jason Momoa's charismatic turn as Duncan Idaho, every member of the ensemble contributes to the film's success, adding layers of complexity to an already rich tapestry of characters.Of course, no discussion of \"Dune Part 2\" would be complete without mentioning the film's thematic depth. At its core, \"Dune\" is a story about power - who wields it, who seeks it, and who ultimately pays the price for its pursuit. Through its exploration of themes such as colonialism, environmentalism, and the nature of prophecy, the film invites audiences to reflect on the timeless questions of ethics and morality that lie at the heart of human existence.In conclusion, \"Dune Part 2\" is a triumph of both storytelling and spectacle, a rare cinematic experience that manages to be both epic in scope and intimate in its emotional resonance. With its stunning visuals, compelling performances, and thought-provoking themes, it stands as a testament to the power of cinema to transport us to worlds beyond our imagination, while also challenging us to confront the truths that lie at the heart of our own humanity.\n",

            "Document 962 (Score: 0.0505): \"Dune: Part Two\" emerges as a cinematic tour de force, encapsulating the essence of Frank Herbert's classic with an execution that can only be described as visually and auditorially mesmerizing. Director Denis Villeneuve's vision transcends the confines of traditional science fiction, elevating this film into a realm of unparalleled immersion, where the desolate beauty of Arrakis and the intricate complexities of Herbert's universe are brought to life with staggering clarity and emotional depth.The visuals in \"Dune: Part Two\" are nothing short of breathtaking. Villeneuve, along with cinematographer Greig Fraser, crafts a visual palette that is as vast and sweeping as the dunes themselves. Each frame is a meticulously designed masterpiece, capturing the stark beauty of the desert landscape, the opulence of the imperial court, and the visceral intensity of the Fremen's struggle. The use of practical effects, augmented by judicious CGI, creates a tactile realism that grounds the story's fantastical elements in a palpable reality. The sweeping shots of Arrakis's desert, the intricate designs of the spaceships and technology, and the hauntingly beautiful Sietches of the Fremen are rendered with such detail and care that they become characters in their own right.Hans Zimmer's score complements the visuals to create an immersive experience that is truly extraordinary. His music for \"Dune: Part Two\" is both haunting and evocative, weaving traditional Middle Eastern motifs with futuristic synths to underscore the film's themes of destiny, power, and transformation. The score ebbs and flows with the narrative, amplifying the emotional resonance of key moments, from the thunderous clashes of battle to the intimate whispers of prophecy. Zimmer's ability to capture the soul of Herbert's universe in his compositions adds a layer of depth to the film that transcends the visual spectacle, ensnaring the audience in a sensory embrace that is both exhilarating and deeply moving.For fans of the original novels, \"Dune: Part Two\" offers a nuanced interpretation of Paul Atreides' journey that both honors and challenges Herbert's intentions. In the books, particularly in \"Dune Messiah,\" Herbert sought to subvert the traditional hero's journey by presenting Paul as a deeply flawed figure, whose rise to power brings about not salvation but suffering. This film bravely embraces that complexity, depicting Paul not as the unblemished hero many have come to expect but as a young man grappling with the weight of prophecy, the seductions of power, and the moral ambiguities of his actions.This portrayal of Paul is a bold narrative choice, reflecting a deeper understanding of Herbert's critique of the hero myth. By emphasizing Paul's darker impulses and the consequences of his decisions, \"Dune: Part Two\" challenges viewers to reconsider their perceptions of leadership, heroism, and destiny. It's a testament to Timothée Chalamet's performance that Paul remains a compelling, if increasingly troubled, protagonist. Chalamet captures the internal conflict of a character caught between destiny and desire, bringing a nuanced depth to Paul that is both captivating and unsettling.The decision to delve into the darker aspects of Paul's character aligns with Herbert's own reflections on the misinterpretation of \"Dune.\" Herbert was concerned that readers glorified Paul as a hero, missing the cautionary tale of power and its pitfalls. This film rectifies that, presenting a vision of Paul that is more in line with Herbert's intentions, and in doing so, enriches the narrative with complexity and ambiguity.\"Dune: Part Two\" is a masterful continuation of Villeneuve's adaptation, a film that not only captures the grandeur and majesty of Herbert's universe but also engages with its most challenging themes. The combination of stunning visuals, a captivating score, and a willingness to explore the moral complexities of its protagonist makes this film a remarkable achievement. It's a cinematic experience that not only entertains but also invites reflection on the nature of power, heroism, and the human condition, solidifying its place as a landmark in science fiction filmmaking.\n",

            "Document 990 (Score: 0.0498): Dune: Part Two has been universally hailed as a sequel worthy of Terminator: Judgment Day, The Godfather Part II, and The Empire Strikes Back; a bonafide epic yielding additional comparisons to Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia; a picture that solidifies Denis Villeneuve as one of the modern titans of the art form. Even those who weren't so hot on the first film, finding its characters monotonous and its visuals largely dull, seem to have been thoroughly won over.And although I enjoyed the visuals and thought there was a purpose to their occasional drabness (imposing brutalist structures towering over nature), the new film indeed cranks the art direction up to eleven, exemplifying some of the most potent visuals in sci-fi history. Although I thought the characters worked fine in the original, in the sequel we're treated to powerhouse newcomers and darker depths to the figures we know -- when critics said \"I liked Dune: Part One just fine, but I just can't buy Timothée Chalamet as the hero\", readers of the Frank Herbert novel snickered (in Part Two, new fans will see why).If nothing else, they find that the whole thing feels more complete (recall that the first movie bamboozled many who hadn't a clue it was just \"Part One\"). Frank Herbert's son, Brian, wrote \"When the new movie is combined with Dune: Part One it is by far the best film interpretation of Dune that has ever been done\".Other things that are expanded on and/or elevated include the performances of Zendaya (one of the most expressive and loveable actors of her generation, underused in the prior movie) as Chani, the young Fremen warrior who welcomed Paul Atreides into their camps after the fall of his \"House\", and Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica, Paul's mother who becomes the \"Reverend Mother\" of the Fremen, who believe she and Paul are instrumental to a prophecy of a mother and child sent to reclaim Planet Arrakis from oppression -- the Imperial spice-mining colonies that now belong to the vile Harkonnen family. On that note, we also get a better look at the Harkonnen homeworld, whose \"black sun\" seems to erase all color from it, bar the blackest of black and whitest of white.This moment is one of many reasons you need to see this in a theater. I cannot stress it enough. These sequences -- from the most thunderous battles and Sandworm rides to the intimate final duel that left my audience at the edge of their seats -- are paralyzing to behold in an auditorium, complete with music and sound design that seem to make the very Earth tremble (then falling dead silent at pivotal moments), all sublimely photographed by \"swirly bokeh\" extraordinaire Greig Fraser. (It's not often you see a film and just know you're witnessing the creation of \"iconic\" images.) The action scenes are elevated by impressive choreography and, of course, the performances.The most intense of the new faces is undoubtedly Austin Butler as Feyd Rautha (that's the Sting character in the 1984 movie, in case you needed the reference), lauded by many as the best villain performance since Anton Chigurh and Ledger's Joker. Additional newcomers include Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan, Léa Seydoux as Lady Fenring of the \"Bene Gesseret\" priestesses, and Christopher Walken as Emperor Shaddam IV.Returning actors include Javier Bardem as the Fremen leader Stilgar, whose incorrigible fanaticism gets some big laughs; Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck, who is out for Harkonnen blood; Stellan Skarsgård as the revolting Baron Harkonnen; Dave Bautista as The Beast Rabban, who envies the affection the Baron shows toward Feyd; and Charlotte Rampling as the Imperial Reverend Mother, who hatches schemes of her own. Certain characters I've mentioned are given just a few minutes of screen time, yet they all make a considerable impact, from the memorable line reads to the looks that speak even louder, most notably during that final exchange of haunting glances between Paul, Chani, and the Princess.At the center is Chalamet as Paul \"Muad'Dib\" Atreides -- a performance that will vindicate his stans and make non-believers hopefully realize not only how formidable he can be, but what he was truly going for in Part One. Chalamet is known for his thin frame and his friendly demeanor; yet, we have absolutely no trouble believing that his Paul would be a master of sparring and a conqueror of Sandworms. As I wrote earlier, those who judged the first movie by how well his story works as a garden-variety \"Hero's Journey\" are bound to have an \"oh\" moment or two.If you're still worried that some of these elements seem lifted from other works, recall that Dune is (likely) an older series than whatever you're thinking of. All the same, even the familiar images feel new here -- epic in scale in a way that cinema hasn't been able to achieve until now. This movie is a close-to-perfect marriage of hitherto unthinkable technology and a crystal-clear vision for said tech to realize. In part, the movie plays as if Villeneuve heard the complaints of the previous film and, as if on a dare, went all the way with his movie magic for the sequel, putting the doubters in their place.Knowing how the books go, I know this franchise is far from done. And despite how long this film was, I never wanted it to end and still crave more, ergo I'm more than stoked to see what Villeneuve does with the rest of Herbert's legendarium and if audiences keep finding resonance in his version of it. The world of Dune is a uniquely well-realized potential future: intimidatingly immense and outlandish on one hand, and dreadfully convincing on the other, showing that Imperialism and colonialism may be alive and well millennia ahead. (Had this film been made with even less studio interference, the parallels between the Fremens' plight and Palestine may have been even more obvious.)The story of Dune Messiah still needs to be adapted and I'm confident that, once Villeneuve shows it to us, the same media illiterates who started posting Film Twitter Takes about how Poor Things approves of misogyny once that film came out on digital won't be taking Paul's \"White Savior\" and Jessica's cultural appropriation at face value -- or so we may hope. An interesting theory from Walter Chaw suggests that the reason so many people keep failing to get the point of Dune -- and Paul Atreides specifically -- is that \"colonialism is so embedded in our value system as manifest destiny\" that it's straight-up impossible for some of us to interpret a figure like this as anything other than a good guy. Lisan al-Gaib, and all that.\n",

I highlight here the character of Stilgar (Javier Bardem) and Chani (Zendaya), who undoubtedly gets one of the great performances of the film. Bravo to Villeneuve for having developed Chani's character (wasted in Herbert's novel), here Chani shines until the end. Bardem, is also a fundamental piece that gives freshness to the serious and majestic plot, adding dynamism and even funny moments.The second half of the film goes to Paul Atreides. I can't say too much here, only that we see one of the greatest evolutions of a character that I've been seen in cinema. The last 45 minutes of the film are simply some of the best I have ever witnessed on a screen. Everything that was harvested in Dune: Part One now makes complete sense. The characters of Florence Pugh and Austin Butler stand out, the first one, in the background but being a totally key character, especially for everything that is going to come (Messiah); and the second one for his excellent performance as a villain (far above the Baron, a villain who personally never convinced me).All of this is great, however, an element of equal importance to everything mentioned was: the music of Hans Zimmer. Spectacular songs and sounds that make you simply feel vibrate (literally... if you see it in Imax) every moment inside you. It is no coincidence that Nolan's best films have Zimmer's seal. His music creates art. His music creates blockbusters. Not because it's commercial, but because it creates emotions within you. Every note, sound and song are placed at the right time and moment in the film. Hans Zimmer's music is undoubtedly the specie, the Water of Life... of Dune: Part Two.With all this we are left with what is not only the best science fiction film ever created, but what is (be careful what I am going to say) the best film of this 21st century (at least to date), with permission from the Dark Knight and Interstellar.Villeneuve gives us a great masterpiece. Here, however, the Messiah is not Paul Atreides, nor Villeneuve himself... The Messiah is the spectator. You. This film will push you to be a better you, it will make you dream big, it will remind you that, like Paul, you can decide when to lead your life and inspire others. You are the Chosen One to, within a simple movie, find the Gold that will make you better in your daily life.This valuable lesson is not achieved by ordinary pieces of art, but only by a few works... which some of us dare to call... MASTERPIECES.Because... in the shadows of Arrakis lie one secret... Dune 2 is a MASTERPIECE.\n",
            "Document 187 (Score: 0.0469): Dune 2 is a stunning sequel that delivers on the promise of the first part and takes the epic sci-fi saga to new heights. Director Denis Villeneuve has crafted a visually spectacular and emotionally gripping film that explores the themes of destiny, power, and resistance in a complex and fascinating universe.The film picks up where the first one left off, with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) joining the Fremen, the native people of the desert planet Arrakis, who are fighting against the brutal rule of the Harkonnen family. Paul is seen by some Fremen as their prophesied messiah, the Kwisatz Haderach, who will lead them to freedom and glory. However, Paul is also haunted by visions of a bloody future that he may not be able to avoid.Dune 2 expands the scope and scale of the story, introducing new characters and locations that enrich the world-building and the plot. We meet the mysterious Bene Gesserit sisterhood, the powerful Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), the cunning Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler), and the fierce Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya), who becomes Paul's love interest. We also travel to different planets, such as the water-rich Caladan, the industrial Giedi Prime, and the imperial Kaitain.The film is a feast for the eyes and ears, with stunning cinematography, production design, costumes, and special effects. The desert landscapes of Arrakis are breathtaking, the sandworms are awe-inspiring, and the space battles are thrilling. The film also boasts a phenomenal score by Hans Zimmer, who creates a haunting and immersive soundscape that blends orchestral, electronic, and ethnic elements. The film is best experienced in IMAX, where the sound and the visuals are amplified to create a truly immersive experience.The film also features excellent performances from the cast, who bring depth and nuance to their roles. Chalamet is superb as Paul, portraying his inner conflict and his growing charisma and confidence. Ferguson is equally impressive as Jessica, who balances her maternal instincts and her loyalty to the Bene Gesserit. Zendaya is captivating as Chani, who shares a strong chemistry with Chalamet and adds a touch of romance to the film. Bardem, Skarsgård, Bautista, and Butler are also memorable as the Fremen leader Stilgar, the grotesque Baron Harkonnen, the savage Beast Rabban, and the sinister Feyd-Rautha, respectively.Dune 2 is not a film that tries to please everyone. It is faithful to the source material by Frank Herbert, which means that it is complex, dense, and challenging. It does not shy away from the dark and violent aspects of the story, nor does it simplify the political and religious implications. It also does not offer a conventional or satisfying conclusion, as it is only the second part of a planned trilogy. However, for those who appreciate the vision and ambition of Villeneuve and Herbert, Dune 2 is a masterpiece that deserves to be seen on the big screen.\n",

As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. The plot and story development are carried out in an awe-inspiring manner throughout the movie, progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does. The film received praise from many great filmmakers, the most notable being Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Oppenheimer), who very accurately compared Villeneuve's achievement in this film to the \"Empire Strikes Back\" of the modern era.Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained. More specifically, one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part. Of course, for those who really want to enjoy the story, there's no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one. However, even those who watched it a few years ago and don't remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt. 2 and will understand all the important details-even the smaller ones. Non-ideally, even someone who hasn't watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one, as it is very self-contained despite relying heavily on the first movie-an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers.Timothée Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance, to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play. Zendaya also gives a very good performance, with significantly more screen time than in the first movie. Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain, Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year, and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie. In addition to them, the film is filled with top-tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly.Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. While the first part was excellent, it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel. In \"Part 2,\" the story reaches its climax, with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades, befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.While the movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1, in my opinion it could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in \"Dune: Messiah\", which I really hope will get green-lit soon.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.Extremely recommended.\n",

What really hit the mark for me is Austin Butler's performance, with his coarse voice and intense demeanor. In fact, the whole sequence on Geidi Prime was for me the best moment of the movies, with the bleak, oppressive lightning of a black sun. Science-fiction at its best.Alas, one aspect lessened my pleasure and it is Zendaya as Chani. I don't know why Hollywood insist so much into giving her femme fatale roles, but each and every time I didn't believe it; Instead of seing the character, all I can see is the same rather plain-looking actress, with her limited range. Maybe she just didn't found her niche yet.On the other hand of the acting spectrum, Bautista is under-rated as an actor here, offering an emotional, convincing performence.

I am an avid fan of the books, so I will say that most of my criticisms or slight complaints come from wishing to see scenes and characters from the book adapted on to screen, but at the same time, most if not all, of these changes make for a better paced and probably less cluttered final product.The cinematography once again is stunning. The gorgeous sands of Arrakis mixed with the colors of different times of day, the larger than life presence of the sandworms, the dismal and brutal gray of Giedi Prime, the various sietches and places of the Fremen. All of it looks gorgeous. The Hanz Zimmer score returning, capturing perfectly the atmosphere of this desert planet. Loved all of it.The performances of characters evolve, most notably Timothee as he becomes Paul Muadib and Lady Jessica as she takes on role of Reverend Mother. Zendaya as Chani gives much-needed depth to that character from the book, Javier as Stilgar was incredible. Each performance was fantastic. Dave Bautista also shines in his role as Beast Rabban. I could go on and on about each performance, but another well done aspect of this film.If you enjoyed Dune Part One in any capacity and long to see where the story of Paul Atreides and the Harkonnens goes from here, you will definitely enjoy this film as the pacing feels very quick and action packed and the world-building from Part One makes it all pay off here.So many scenes from this Part Two took my breath away and I think Denis did an incredible job adapting the second half of this epic story, despite several changes from the source material.

Its supposed to be an adaptation and part of me does expect the general spirit of the characters to be maintained, even if some of the detail wasnt.Book fans may be disappointed. The writer and director take liberties with the source material, fundamentally changing the nature of a main character. If jars as a book fan to see how they treated Chani. Not only that, but it also makes further Dune movies likely to deviate even further from the source.*spoilers*It was a common complaint that Chani was.little used in the first part of the adaptation. Zendaya appeared fleetingly and had almost no significant input into things. Clearly that's not the case in part 2, but her part in the story is significantly different from the original source.In part 2, Chani seems to switch between loving Paul to telling anybody who'll listen that he's not the messiah and is instead somewhat of a naughty boy. It makes the intimate, romantic stuff seem out of place against her continued effort to undermine the prophecy that he's the voice from another world who'll lead the Fremen to freedom. The 2 sides to Chani really do jar against each other. The romance never feels particularly genuine when she seems to switch from lover to critic in the space of a few minutes of run time.Should that matter? For the movie it possibly doesnt, other than being annoying. But this is the girl who's supposed to be the mother of 3 children to Paul. So to have her storm out of the scene with Princess Irulan and to then end the film with the spurned lover calling a worm to ride alone into the desert has a far bigger negative impact. Book readers know what Chani's role should be. We know what she does in Dune Messiah and how things play out in Children. If there is going to be an adaptation of the 2nd, and maybe even 3rd, books in Herbert's series then Dune part 2 hasn't exactly made it easy to get things back on track. Paul is going to have to do some pretty incredible making up if he;s going to convince the rather detached Chani to be the mother of his kids in time for a potential Messiah adaptation.It's not all bad. The cinematography is great. The sound is fantastic. The scene with Paul addressing the council of naibs is genuinely incredible. His snarling performance in front of his doubters, almost inviting them to challenge him before destroying any of their doubts with his deeply personal knowledge of their history and their ways is one of the finest scenes in recent cinema. Chalamet plays the scene perfectly. Sadly the rest of the movie can't quite reach that high point. The final battlle for Arakeen feels a good few minutes shorter than it should be. The Harkonen character design never feels particularly well done and Beast Raban is more pantomime villain than the guy sent to brutalise the Arakis population.Does any of that matter? If I'd never read the original source material then it probably wouldn't. I'd be a little bit unsure of the character development but I'd probably feel that most of the constituent parts of an epic scifi classic were there. It's a flawed movie, but those flaws probably wouldn't be such an issue as they are for me as a fan of the books.Ultimately the director and writer have told their version of the Dune novel over 2 movies. It's just that the character changes not only fail to help the movie, but they flat out detract from it and it ends up feeling like a wasted opportunity. It could have been better and it could have set the foundation for a generational series of films.\n",

This is the best experience with a film I probably have ever had.I'm going to split this up into two parts, the first without spoilers and the second half will contain some pretty big spoilers that I need to address.Spoiler Free:Where do I even begin... from the very beginning scene you can tell this is going to be phenomenal. If you liked Dune 2021 at least a faint bit you will most likely love this. Everything from the first film is elevated tenfold. You can feel the amount of pure passion and love that Denis Villeneuve and the entire crew poured onto this behemoth of a project. Easily another Oscar sweep for Dune, this time it'll most likely win Best Picture because I can't fathom another film getting this close to perfection ever again or at least in the near future. Visually unexplainably beautiful. If you get the chance you need to watch it in IMAX or just the largest screen and loudest speakers you possibly can. The black and white Feyd-Rautha sequence is edited to unfathomable levels of perfection, hell that's just one of the scenes I can say that for. This movie has at least ten of the most bad-ass shots I've ever seen. Hans Zimmer's score is crafted with his usual mastery and is complimented so greatly by Greig Fraser's visuals in a beautiful tango of sight and sound.The conflicts our characters face are so intriguing and immersive, that we understand what they're going through, the dire decisions they have to make, and what it will cost them. The commentary on faith, purpose, and what is too far? It's so much more than a pretty sci-film movie with cool sounds, there is so much soul and so much to say and it executes every beat it wants to hit without fail. From giant epic battles to deep, personal, emotional, and quiet conversations it all blends as one beautiful portrait that is easily Denis Viellenueves Magnum Opus.The entire cast bodies every roll. Timothee Chalamet is the perfect Paul Atreides he handles his character with such power and gives off this Aura that I haven't seen in a very long time, may be the best character ever written that I've seen. If you don't care about this film at all that's okay, but please watch it to see his performance at least. Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha is even more menacing than he is in the books and, again, is transformed into a performance I could see getting him another Oscar Nomination. Rebecca Ferguson's Lady Jessica has this presence that I can't even put into words. Zendaya's Chani has this beautiful chemistry with Chalamet's Paul Atreides with an irreplicable story between them so greatly displayed.I LOVED the costume design accompanied by some spectacular lighting that compliments each other in a way I haven't seen anything close to it.This is absolute Sci-Fi perfection. This is tied or even surpasses Empire as the best Sci-Fi film of all time and is the easiest top four I have ever put on this account, and it won't leave that's for sure. Every person who worked on this is a master at their craft and will be remembered throughout history as the people who put together potentially the greatest story ever told. I heard all the praise that this film got and knew after reading the book that it was going to be easily one of my favorites, but nothing could have prepared me for it to be as good as it was. Genuinely cannot think of a complaint. I commented on the first Dune how I wish there was an extended edition, not needed anymore. Denis Villeneuve couldn't have done better. He elevated the emotion and intensity of everything that happens in the novel with numerous additions to the source material while still being perfectly faithful. The only thing that saddens me is that Frank Herbert himself couldn't have watched this, I just know this is exactly what he wanted and what he deserved for his masterpiece of a novel.I can't express what this movie means to me, I'll be rewatching it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. I've thrown around the phrase \"This is my Empire Strikes Back\" a few times like when I watched Endgame for example, but this is truly the only film that is deserving of that phrase. I'm so thankful I had the opportunity to see it all unfold in IMAX with a packed theater of pure Dune fans. It felt like home.LONG LIVE CINEMA.SPOILERS:\n",

            "THEY GAVE GURNEY HIS BALISET!!!!! I genuinely got so excited that he got his few seconds with it. Denis' adaptation is so faithful to the source material while still having some insane creative liberties that for the first time (outside of his first Dune) just increases the quality.I LOVED what he did with Princess Irulan where we got to see her actually record the excerpts we read at the beginning of every chapter, such a great detail that lets us dive deeper into her character that barely makes an appearance in the actual book. Actually, Denis Villeneuve does a wonderful job of extending the appearances of all these characters that weren't in the novel in the first place. We get so much Rabban which makes me so happy, I was wishing we had gotten more of him in the first film because he's a pretty important character who we don't see much action from already in the book. So us being able to see him at his fullest during this was great. I can't even begin to talk about Feyd-Rautha... what a character, his presence is only matched by Muad'dib himself (who I will get to shortly). He's so menacing and evil... I love him. Getting to see him just slash people for simply questioning him was awesome and I'm so glad we got to see even more parallels between him and Muad'dib especially the added Gom Jabbar that I don't recall being a part of the novel, hell 90% of his scenes weren't in the novel but are all so in character and perfectly done that it's as if it was all a part of the original writing.Paul Atreides, Muad'dib, Usul, Kwisatz Harderach, Lisanal whatever you want to call him is easily one of the best characters ever put onto screen. I've said it already a few times, but the AURA that Chalamet brings to this character is something I can't put into words and is something that needs to be experienced. The shift in his character as we see him slowly accept his terrible purpose is so brilliantly displayed. The expressions in his eyes, the way he presents himself, all of it changes ever so slightly as we see him being The One. I remember after reading the book I revisited Dune 2021 and was lost on why they left out the revelation that the Baron is Lady Jessica's Father/ Paul's Grandfather. I remember thinking that this movie was gonna be half flashbacks because of scenarios like that and was slightly worried. I will never put an ounce of doubt on Villeneuve ever again. The way that it's revealed is so well done that it was another one of those moments where you'd think that it was written like that originally. Paul's conflict is so well displayed I loved seeing the really dark undertones that he was showing as the film progressed realizing that this war is a necessary thing to happen and no matter what that throne has to be taken. It's exactly what Frank Herbert would have wanted after he had to make an entire second book just because everyone thought Paul was a perfect hero, Denis handled that misconception perfectly and I can't wait for Dune Messiah (God please let it be greenlit) to see him fully handle the aftermath. That means I'm going to be reading Dune Messiah ASAP.I thought the choice of Alia not being born and no real mention of Leto II was very interesting but definitely didn't take anything away from the film. It definitely would be weird and difficult to have a four-year-old act like an all-knowing Bene Gesserit woman. I love how it also allowed for the chance of Paul killing the Baron himself which in my opinion was much more satisfying than Alia doing it. Speaking of satisfying death I loved how Gurney was the one who was able to kill Rabban after he mentioned that he killed his family as well as gave him the scar on his face much much more satisfying. Lady Jessica talking to Alia with her still in the womb I thought was really cool and perfectly displayed the connection the Bene Gesserit have with each other as well as a cool nod to the mother-daughter bond.Every battle (especially the final one) has so much raw emotion and strength with this scale that cannot be matched. I was grinning from ear to ear so much that I wish I had a camera set on me throughout the whole thing. The Atreides banner being waved on top of sandworms is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The Feyd-Rautha birthday gladiator fight is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The final battle between Muad'dib and Feyd-Rautha is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The world-building as we dive further into Arrakis and Giedi Prime is one of the coolest things I'll ever see. The conflicts between Bene Gesserit, Fremen, Atreides, Harkonnen, Sardaukar, and Guild, is one of the coolest things I'll ever see.I could type for years, but I need to just let this soak for a bit, I'll be writing more with every watch of this I have.\n",

In part 2 there was obviously a great deal more development and yet there were several pockets of the movie that just felt like a waste of time. When things were happening they felt rushed and undersold and when they weren't they just dragged on.For example - Paul's pre born sister Alia felt wildly underwhelming. And she's one of the biggest reveals of the books. I also felt like Villeneuve left maybe a bit too much on the cutting room table. Part 2 felt oddly g-rated. The violence was largely bloodless like a marvel movie and intimate scenes were shot from the shoulders up.Dune is far more adult than that. Personally that's what I've been \"thirsting\" for. A movie like this made for adults.Performances were by and large well done.Chalamet turns in his usual subdued but strong performance.Zendaya seems a little out of place this time around now that she actually had a role rather than only being in visions. She mostly reminded me of an angry 12 year old boy.Javier Bardem and his fanatical Stilgar were great and once he becomes a believer you can see Bardem really start to have fun.Rebecca Ferguson is still by far the strongest actor in this series. Every shot she's in - you just don't blink. She's absolutely mesmerizing.Josh Brolin does his Josh Brolin thing. Serves his purpose.Austin Butler, you can tell puts alot of work into his roles. He does well here.Florence Pugh is more like furniture to me. Like everything I've seen her in I know she's there but I'm not really paying attention to her. In Oppenheimer I realized I was ignoring her when she was on screen and I wasn't even doing it on purpose.Which leads me to my problems with this cut of the film - Pugh and Christopher Walken just felt empty.There wasn't enough time spent trying to understand them. Less b-roll of the desert and maybe more focus on character development would have been good.Why would the emperor kill Paul's father who was like a son to him? I know they explained it but it didn't feel... enough. I didn't know or care enough about the character or his motivations to feel genuine. Even if his reasons were manufactured by a certain group and exacerbated by his own pettiness, fear, and jealousy. This is a movie. This is Show not Tell.With all of that being said - Dune Part 2 is by far the best thing to come out of Hollywood in years which is why people are freaking out like it's the 2nd coming.

This reminded me of the character arc of Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones, where her evolution felt sudden and unearned.

Casting, acting, world building, sound, cinematography, everything is great.Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson are the stars of the show and both perfectly deliver the transition to manipulative, unsympathetic characters. Compared to the first one where they are victims of betrayal and you feel for their loss, in this one you only feel sympathy for them until you realize the only reason is knowing the Harkonnen are so much worse. Paul is not a hero, something the first movie didn't make clear.The rest of the cast is great. Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin and Stellan Skarsgard are great as usual. Dave Bautista has surprising range and seems to do his best work with Villeneuve on the helm. I'm seeing a lot of praise for Austin Butler and his performance was good, but not anything extraordinary. His character is a psychopath and doesn't leave much room for subtlety. Zendaya is good, but in the beginning it feels like she's replaying her character from Spider Man. She has only two modes, annoyed and concerned. She does much better on the second half. Christopher Walken is great, obviously, but it was distracting to cast such a well-known actor as a character that wasn't even shown before and who is very reserved and secluded by the very nature of his role.The movie is almost 3 hours long and it didn't feel that much, but it had some minor pacing issues. It feels rushed at some points and I think it lacked some transition scenes. For instance, I wanted to see more transitions with spaceships in space, like we see once in the first one. They make the vast distances between planets clearer and increase the sense of isolation and remoteness of Arrakis. The movie doesn't really feel like an interplanetary epic. It feels like everything is happening very close.I wish the role of spice was made clearer in the first one and it wasn't, so I was expecting that in this one and I was disappointed it was overlooked again. Without showing the navigators, their role and the transformations they go through, the spice feels more like a McGuffin than an integral part of the plot. I'm not a fan of the books but I know the navigators are really introduced only in Messiah. However, I think having an earlier hint of their role and the real importance of spice would make the stakes clearer, specially when we see Paul's visions about the future and his decision to go through with it, knowing what will happen.Overall, its few minor flaws are due to things that are missing, and I'm sure Villeneuve had to make many hard decisions about what to leave out of the movie to keep the runtime reasonable.\n",

It's definitely the best creation ever made for Dune but it's not a \"masterpiece\" and the epic moments in it are so short that actually made me angry.Beside the many changes compared to the origin story (some good & some bad that I could live with), the movie focuses too much on the relationship between Paul and Chani while missing many other major issues that some of them didn't even get screen time. Chani's part is just way too big; the fact that the movie ends up with her face symbolizes that.But the thing that was the most disappointing for me is the action scenes in the big assault of the Fremen at the end; that were very epic with maybe 2 minutes long! I think Villeneuve messed this up big time.The shadukar, the strongest force of the emperor in the universe, I want to see more how it's defeated. The defeat of all the Harkonnen forces also almost nothing of it was shown. We didn't even get to see Paul storms with the Fremen and fight in this battle. At the point when they reach to the emperor and his people, there was a line of Shadukar troops walking into the fog and disappearing before Paul arrives; Why not make a small action scene there?! I really don't get it. I didn't expect this movie to contain long big scale action sequences just like Lord of the Rings movies, but it seems to me that the director was literally trying to avoid them no matter what.I've seen the movie twice since I like Dune so much. It has one of the best casts ever made (Rebecca Ferguson performance is remarkable), the story is more than amazing, the visuals & dressings are stunning, the sound off course is mind blowing- all were so excellent.This really should have been the best Science Fiction movie since decades.

Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) unite with the Fremen in their quest to avenge their betrayed family. Paul must prove himself as the so called messiah, the \"Lisan al Gaib\", to unite the different Fremen colonies and overthrow the emperor out of power. He alongside Chani (Zendaya), a fierce warrior and ambitious love interest, will be tested by the brutality of the desert and even more brutal Harkonnens.I'll start by saying this surpasses the first film. The depth and weight of the events that are carried out in this sequel are even more intriguing than the first. The first act mainly gives time for Paul and Chani's relationship development. It follows Paul's trials to becoming Fremen (with a particular scene in mind that I won't spoil for you but it involves a sand worm and is one if not my favorite sequence of the entire film). You are also introduced to new characters like the Emperor played by the legendary Christopher Walken and Princess Irulan played by Florence Pugh, who both are excellent in the film. This is only the first act.The Dune films are brought to life by an ensemble of actors who truly give it their all and portray their characters beautifully. Two performances that stood out for me were Javier Bardem and Austin Butler's \"Stilgar\" and \"Feyd-Rautha\". Props to Javier for including here some awesome comedic timing. His subtle nuances give out these wonderful moments for a good laugh, and it works for me so well because it is unexpected. On the other hand, Austin gives this demonic portrayal which gave me a whole new prospective on his cepabilities as an actor, terrifying but amazing.Each character is further explored and given time to shine. If the first film was more about acknowledging the lore of the Dune universe to the viewers, this film is more about our character's development and arcs.The score of this film somehow got even better than the first one. So much emotion and love was given here. Furthermore, I recently found out the cinematographer who worked on both Dune films is the same one who worked on films which I love like \"The Batman\" and \"The Creator\". Greig Fraser's capture of shots in Dune Part Two will blow your mind. Oscar worthy. The shots that stand out for me are the wide shots. They are glorious. With the mixture of a superb soundtrack by the brilliant Hans Zimmer, the angelic beauty of Greig Fraser's shots and of course the direction of Denis Villeneuve, you are left with a masterpiece.This film is truly a triumph of cinema. In all honesty, I would love for them to make a third film and conclude this into a trilogy but I am also good with them leaving it the way it is. I am fulfilled by the ending and entertained to my core. What an experience, wow.\n",

Most movies nowadays try to wow you with either visuals, action, character development, and seemingly less and less so everyday with a reasonable plot. This movie manages to check off every box. It is hard to pinpoint an actor in it that wasn't superb in their role. The visual effects, especially in IMAX , are stunning and are not simply artistic in nature, but actually work to advance the plot.The film is pieced together so brilliantly with each act seamlessly fitting in with the last. The score by Zimmer is unsurprisingly absolute perfection as well.For the length of the movie it actually feels quite short which is a huge achievement and shows how immersed you become in Villneuve's world.However, I would have liked to see more of Feyd Rautha. They had an epic scene of his in the Harkonnen arena, but not too much else to develop him for his final battle against Paul. I also would have liked to see the Sardaukar put up a little better of a fight. They somehow went from the empires greatest fighters to pretty pathetic. Perhaps this was to show how strong Paul and his forces had become, but it just seemed a bit too easy. Still these are just personal aspects I would have liked to see and are not issues in the movie itself.Overall, an epic movie, and the trilogy is likely to be sitting right alongside The Lord of the Rings and the original Star Wars movies when all is said and done.This is a can't miss in IMAX.\n",

He stayed as true as possible to the original story with very few, albeit minor changes from the novel. The reasons behind this were understandable; deliver Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" in a manner that modern audiences could digest and walk away from understanding and appreciating what they had just experienced.Dune: Part Two arrives; critics and influencers alike are toting the film as a \"masterclass of filmmaking\" and \"best science fiction movie of all time to date\".I am fair and give credit where credit is due. The characters and their execution of their roles were flawless, the cinematography was awe-inspiring, the action was jaw-dropping, and the musical scoring was outstanding setting every mood and tone perfectly.So, why six stars? The story. Hands down, the story.There are creative liberties taken by Villeneuve that I believe hurts the original material. Many of these liberties are easily identified in the film by \"holy crap!\" moments, and the *GASP* moments in the film. Granted, while, once again, masterfully executed, they accomplished exactly what it felt like they were meant to do - get shock value. Whether these changes were studio decisions, or Villeneuve's, remains to be seen.Had Villeneuve followed his original formula from Dune: Part One into Dune: Part Two, following the narrative from Frank Herbert's original works, I still think this film would have impressed beyond measure. Unfortunately, in its release state, I believe Dune: Part Two fails the audience by robbing them of the true experience that is Dune - the story.This is how I felt leaving the theater; let down. Is it a visually stunning and well executed movie? Yes. Is it true to the source material? No.I leave viewers, enthusiasts, and fans of the original novels a fair observation and warning.

            "Format: (Digital) IMAXIt's safe to say that Dune Part 2 is basically an expansion of Part One. More characters are added, the story is now more complex and 10x interesting with much going on, and the world of Dune is bigger.However, with lots of negativities in my opinion, the positivities are much stronger to not ruin the experience nor lower the rating.Director Denis Villeneuve proves himself again in Part Two that he is the perfect director to direct the Dune project. In addition, all the crew that helped in delivering this project truly did an accurate and amazing job to deliver this world the way it is supposed to be delivered.The VFX in this film is absolutely amazing and not noticeable expect for very few scenes that is obvious about the use of green screens but this will not ruin the experience at all. Also, the cinematography that captures Arrakis (where most of the film is held in) absolutely supports the VFX in capturing some great shots that most of them are long wide shots to capture the beautiful desert. Moreover, most of the times the characters are positioned to be in the middle of the long wide shot to capture the size of the character comparing to the world around them mostly to show off their vulnerability or their strong abilities depending in the character.The film is so much inspired by the middle eastern culture in terms of the language, clothings, production design, movements, and all the beliefs that most of the characters follow.Hans Zimmer's music is perfectly composed and really loved how in most of the fight sequences, there is no music to be played in the background making the whole attention pointed towards the fight movements which increases the nervousness and tense vibe.Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya are absolutely amazing. Paul Atreides (played by Timothée Chalamet) have reached his peak and prime level. By the end of this film, he is no longer the young Paul Atreides, he is the most powerful man in Arrakis and no one can top him nor control him. He is written with so much care that will make you recall the version that we saw in Part One and how his long journey that we experienced with him wasn't that easy. And this might be one of the greatest character studies/character development stories in cinema history, and Timothée Chalamet had a huge part in achieving that. By the end of Part Two, you will realize that Chalamet is indeed the perfect actor to portray Paul Atreides due to Chalamet's deep portraying during the different stages that his character goes through in this film and mostly moments of anger and strength on other characters. However, the real surprise is Rebecca Ferguson as her character really went through many changes in this film in which it was really shown due to Rebecca's acting. She was absolutely able to deliver the terrifying and powerful characteristics of her character Jessica. The second biggest surprise is Austin Butler as Fyed-Rautha as both his make-up design and acting was able to bring this character to screen the way it is suppose to be in the book.For the negativities:-With the same mistake that is in Dune Part One, Part Two (and the whole Dune saga) highly needs to be 'Rated R' to allow some gore, bloody, and disgusting violence scenes to be present in the film, and part Two has the perfect chance due to the amount of fight sequences specifically with Austin Butler's character, Feyd-Rautha that had epic fight sequences that were shot in Black & White and I think it's obvious the reason behind shooting them in Black & White.-Unfortunately the seriousness in this film has been lowered significantly. Especially with Javier Bardem's character Stilgar that cracks most of the jokes. What happened to Stolgar that walked in on Oscar Isaac's Duke Leto Atredius in Part One with much confident and seriousness refusing to give anything about his people?Also, Dave Batista's character Glossu Rabban is so weak in this film and we barely saw him defending himself or even being powerful which is something that does not fit with Batista's physical appearance nor the character's characteristics or the 'brutal' House Harkonnen that he represents.-(NOT A SPOILER AS IT WAS ANNOUNCED BY DIRECTOR DENIS VILLENEUVE)\n",

Since when do actors and actresses that have a surprise role in a film appear at the red carpet premiere?

            "Document 511 (Score: 0.0359): \"Dune: Part Two,\" despite its ambitious attempt to continue the epic saga, falls significantly short of the expectations set by its predecessor, leaving much to be desired in both narrative depth and character development. Where Denis Villeneuve's first installment offered a visually stunning and philosophically rich entrance into the universe of Frank Herbert's iconic series, this sequel struggles to maintain that momentum, veering into the realm of cinematic redundancy and superficial spectacle.The film's pacing is one of its most glaring issues. It oscillates between rushed sequences that skim over crucial plot points and tedious stretches where little of consequence happens. This erratic tempo not only disrupts the narrative flow but also undermines the story's emotional weight, leaving the audience disengaged from what should be high-stakes moments.Character development, or the lack thereof, further detracts from the film's appeal. Newcomers to the cast are introduced with great fanfare but are given scant screen time to evolve beyond one-dimensional figures. This oversight is particularly disappointing given the rich backstories and intricate personalities that define Herbert's characters. Even returning characters, who were previously portrayed with depth and complexity, are reduced to mere shadows of their former selves, often acting out of character or being pushed to the sidelines.Visually, \"Dune: Part Two\" continues to impress with its breathtaking landscapes and meticulous attention to detail in costume and production design. However, these aesthetic achievements cannot compensate for the film's narrative shortcomings. The reliance on CGI spectacle over substantive storytelling feels like a missed opportunity to explore the novel's themes of power, ecology, and human nature.Moreover, the script seems to struggle with balancing the source material's dense political intrigue with the need for blockbuster action sequences. As a result, much of the film's potential for thoughtful commentary on imperialism and environmentalism is lost in translation, replaced by generic battle scenes that lack the emotional resonance seen in the first film.In conclusion, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a visually captivating but ultimately unsatisfying continuation of the Dune saga. Its failure to capitalize on the groundwork laid by its predecessor results in a sequel that feels both overloaded and superficial. While die-hard fans may find moments to enjoy, those seeking the depth and nuance of the original will likely be left wanting more. This sequel, unfortunately, suggests that in attempting to broaden its appeal, the franchise has sacrificed the very elements that made it distinctive and compelling in the first place.\n",

Timothee Chalamet *finally* gains a much needed edge to his acting vernacular, his Paul Atreides metamorphosing from timid, sheltered introvert prince into fearless and often frightening messiah in the making is a staggering turn.

The film's best performance goes to Zendaya though, her desert warrior princess Chani is a captivating character respite with rough resilience, tender resolve and bruised vulnerability when certain heartbreaking plot revelations unfold, she's perfect. Everything that was just beginning to fire up in the first film is roaring on full blast here; the battles are sensational, tactile ballets of machinery in motion, explosive projectiles obliterating spice harvesters, lithely ruthless hand to hand combat, invigorating rides atop the immense sand worms complete with immersive POV shots and enough super sonic sound design to make you actually *believe* you are there. The emotional resonance is present too amidst all the beautiful chaos of battle, a hero's journey that could easily spill into intergalactic horror if wrong choices are made, and ill favoured destinies are followed.

Yes, unequivocally.While a lot of people are talking up Austin Butler's performance (and believe me, it is awesome), I really feel the shining star of the movie is Timothy Chalamet. Without giving too much away, he has to play almost 3 versions of the same character in this movie, and he frankly hits it out of the park in scenes I was expecting he'd be challenged by.

Stunning cinematography, and the soundscape is extremely well composed.But, what is has in spades on the technical front, it severely lacks on other fronts. Unlike the prequel, this movie takes several departures from the book, most of which I'm not entirely sure why, and some seems downright uncharacteristic. As an example, Chani's disbelief in the prophecy. I get that the persuasion of the Fremen is a key in the story, and this is a way to highlight it further, but her being in love with Paul, and then not believing in him or supporting him at all, at times directly disrespecting him, seems very irrational.In general, the characters felt shallow and I had no engagement in them whatsoever. I don't think Timothee Chalamet was well cast as Paul. Acting was overall decent, but there somehow was something missing in terms of character depth and development. I think it comes down to the pacing of the movie. Example when Paul needs to learn to ride the worms, one scene is Stilgar telling him it requires a lot to master, next scene is literally Paul riding the biggest worm they have ever seen.The storytelling also completely fails to convey the complexity of the political system, the role of spice, and how each player tries to take advantage.In the end, a grand attempt at translating a classic book, that ultimately falls short on character depth/development and overall storytelling.

The scenery, world-building, character development, music, sound effects, pacing, and overall feeling, in my opinion, perfect for this story.

He never at any point gave off a quality of strength or courage. In part two he did better but his character just wasnt all that likeable. Ive never seen timothee in any other films so I am not sure if this is an cast issue or a director issue. Zendeya was also a poor fit. She is a very mediocre actress.

So for the last week I've left all my thoughts to myself for me to truly think how I feel about this movie. After my first showing, I loved it but I came out with a feeling I wasn't satisfied and it's probably because of the changes made from the novel whereas today I have no doubt in my head of how I feel. This movie is perfect.There's genuinely so much I love about this that if I wanted, I could go through every single scene and say how brilliant it is. Firstly with the movie itself, the pacing is just godly. How on earth is that an almost 3 hour movie when it flies by faster than sand in the wind. Secondly the sound editing? Unbelievable. The visuals are without a doubt just the best thing from VFX to camera work to cinematography.But finally the acting is where this movie shines. Every actor is honestly carrying this movie and that's what you expect with a stacked cast like this. Timothy is the definition of Paul Atreides. He was born for this role and I pray it's his legacy because he gave it his all and more. The scene in the sietch with his fathers ducal signet is one of the best scenes I've ever seen. His acting in the final scene is academy level he at the very least needs to be nominated.Zendaya does wonders for Chani especially for me. As a huge Dune series fan, Chani is a good character but she doesn't at all stand out in the books. But when she was announced to be played by Zendaya I knew this would be a twist and man I'm happy with the way Denis took her arc. She's probably my favourite character in the movie which is saying a lot with how she's not even top 10 in the books. It's crazy how much facial expressions does and Zendaya plays that perfectly. The love she has you can read it just as well as the anger at the end. I cannot wait to see how Denis uses her in Messiah especially with how she's on a complete different path now.The final actor that really stood out for me is Austin Butler. Doesn't have the biggest screen time but his role is perfect and I knew it the moment you hear him laughing in his arena battle. He plays this role in such a way it made me care for Feyd-Rautha even though he's a little no villain with little character outside of that. I could go on about every actor because they all do something that makes this movie special but yeah overall just a brilliant cast and a perfect movie.The final thing I have to say is that score that plays from the moment the Emperor kisses the Ducal signet till the end of the movie and the score during the credits, godly level of work from Zimmer he was the best choice for this movie and he delivered beyond perfection for both Parts.\n",

Directed by visionary filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, this sequel transports viewers back to the mesmerizing world of Arrakis, weaving a tapestry of intrigue, betrayal, and heroism on an unprecedented scale.From the outset, it is evident that \"Dune: Part Two\" is a labor of love, meticulously crafted with an unwavering commitment to honoring Frank Herbert's iconic source material. The film picks up seamlessly where its predecessor left off, plunging viewers into a world on the brink of war as the battle for control of Arrakis intensifies.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its masterful storytelling. Villeneuve deftly navigates the intricate narrative threads, balancing exposition with heart-pounding action to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Each character is given ample room to grow and evolve, their motivations and conflicts explored with depth and nuance. Whether it's the charismatic Paul Atreides grappling with his destiny as the prophesied messiah or the enigmatic Lady Jessica torn between loyalty to her son and the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, every character feels fully realized and essential to the story's unfolding drama.Visually, \"Dune: Part Two\" is nothing short of breathtaking. The sweeping vistas of Arrakis, brought to life with stunning practical and visual effects, serve as a mesmerizing backdrop for the film's epic narrative. From the towering sandworms that roam the desert to the intricately designed fremen sietches, every aspect of the world-building is executed with meticulous attention to detail, immersing viewers in a universe that feels both fantastical and eerily familiar.At the heart of the film lies its exceptional ensemble cast, led by the incomparable performances of Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson. Chalamet brings a quiet intensity to the role of Paul Atreides, capturing the character's internal struggle with poise and conviction. Ferguson, meanwhile, delivers a standout performance as Lady Jessica, infusing the character with a complexity and strength that elevates her beyond the typical archetype of the genre.Supporting performances from the likes of Oscar Isaac, Zendaya, and Javier Bardem further enrich the film's tapestry, each actor bringing depth and gravitas to their respective roles. Whether it's Isaac's portrayal of the noble Duke Leto Atreides or Bardem's charismatic turn as the fremen leader Stilgar, every character leaves a lasting impression, contributing to the film's rich and immersive world.Yet, perhaps the most remarkable aspect of \"Dune: Part Two\" is its thematic depth. Beneath its epic spectacle lies a poignant exploration of power, religion, and the consequences of unchecked ambition. As the various factions vie for control of Arrakis, the film forces viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about human nature and the corrupting influence of power. It's a timely and thought-provoking commentary that resonates long after the credits roll, inviting viewers to ponder the implications of our actions in an increasingly complex world.In conclusion, \"Dune: Part Two\" stands as a triumphant achievement in modern cinema, a sprawling epic that dazzles the senses while challenging the mind. With its masterful storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and stellar performances, it cements Denis Villeneuve's status as one of the preeminent filmmakers of our time. For fans of science fiction and cinema alike, \"Dune: Part Two\" is an experience not to be missed-an unforgettable journey to the heart of Arrakis and beyond.\n",

The fact that time flew like a bird while watching this film was a special expression that there was no lack of excitement.Also, I can't say that the film was too abrupt. There was love, depression and compassion very cleverly woven in. The film offered the whole spectrum of emotions.Speaking of the actors, Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides did an excellent job, offering both character development and the inner dilemmas of gaining power.

But Villeneuve and his crew absolutely pulled it off again with this mesmerising masterpiece that pulled me down to the surface of Arrakis and pushed me through a religious revolution without ever letting go.That's not to deny its flaws. It's probably a bit too long. Some characters are turned into a caricature of themselves. Some deviations from the book were clearly done for brevity, but others are serious deviations that will surely have major ramifications as the story continues. It hits a little too hard on the nose with its core message that religion is a great power but morally ambiguous.All of that is nit-picking however. The film manages to combine multiple plot lines, character development and world building without sacrificing pace or relying on fight scenes to keep the momentum going. It's true to the broad strokes (and some of the smaller ones) of Frank Herbert's vision, but perfectly accessible to someone who only saw part one years ago. Every piece of the film making craft comes together in this beautiful sci-fi epic. For once, the cliche that watching a film in a cinema (with the largest screen you can get to) is an 'experience' rings true.\n",

However, for as wonderful as Herbert's universe is, often the female characters are underdeveloped and lack agency. Villeneuve recognises this and we gain a more nuanced and complex Chani, Irulan and Jessica. Chani perhaps gains the most development, with her actively pushing against Pauls plans and featuring alongside him during major battles. Zendaya is perfectly cast, she brings an emotional weight to Chani's character that i have always found to be missed opportunity within the first book.Usually I'm against directors making major changes within book to film adaptations, and as the first film was fairly truthful to its source I was intrigued to how this would change with part 2. Major changes are made, most obviously being a smaller time jump in which we miss out of on the brith of Alia. Thank goodness, because while I am a fan of Alia within the book, an adult/child hybrid portrayed through live action is risky and often falls flat (Renesmee anyone?). I felt we still gained the importance of Alia's presence and also a great addition of Anya Taylor Joy who hopefully we get to see more of in potential sequels!Arguably, this is one of the most stunning films ever made, with attention to detail coming in an abundance. If you enjoyed the first then RUN to see it. I often hear complaints from people that nothing happens during the part one, try part two as I challenge you to not be bored during this delicious sequel!\n",
            "Document 873 (Score: 0.0303): Dune holds a special place in my heart as one of my all-time favorite books that has never received the same level of mainstream attention that the Star Wars universe has, which is some sort of cosmic irony considering how much Star Wars lore owes to the Dune novels and also to Jodorowsky's Dune. (Disclaimer: I am an unabashed Star Wars fanatic. Please don't take this as a slight towards my favorite fandom). Much like the Star Wars vs. Dune conundrum when it comes to popularity, Denis Villeneuve is one of my favorite directors who holds a special place in my heart because he has made a lot of great movies that unfortunately haven't been box office sensations. Another modern director that he often gets compared to is Christopher Nolan who unlike Denis not only makes great movies, but has had a lot more financial box office hits. While I am extremely happy for Nolan especially since I rank him high on My Favorite Directors list, Denis Villeneuve continues to bring out the inner sci-fi nerd in me because he has arguably been the best sci-fi director of the 21st century. Sci-fi when done right, is my favorite genre of fiction whether it be books, video games, tv shows, or movies, Up until this point, Denis had made four straight films that were deemed hits by audiences and critics alike, but he never did reach mega box-office success. I couldn't be happier with the success that Dune Part 2 has had.The day was Saturday, March 2, 2024 and I was finally going to see my most anticipated movie since Dune [Dune: Part One]. As I sunk into the plush theater seat, I was swept up by a wave of nostalgia mixed with anticipation. The metallic voice of the Sardaukar pierced the silence, uttering those immortal words: \"Power over spice is power over all\". With that we were whisked back to Arrakis and got to experience for the next 2 hours and 46 minutes, one of the most influential stories of the sci-fi genre finally being told in a way that would be accessible to most audiences.From this point on there will be spoilers to both the book and the film below.Dune's accessibility to a broader audience marked a significant departure from some of the more intricate aspects of the original story. For instance, in Frank Herbert's novel, Alia, Paul's sister, is portrayed as a preternaturally gifted child who ages rapidly due to her exposure to the spice mélange in the womb while also receiving the knowledge of all of the Reverend Mothers before receiving any agency herself. However, in Villeneuve's adaptation, Alia is reimagined as a fetus communicating telepathically with Lady Jessica, her mother. This alteration not only simplifies Alia's character arc but even more importantly, it saves Denis Villeneuve the trouble of having to find a toddler actress that not only is capable of quality acting, but also has parents who would be comfortable enough with letting their little girl crawl/walk around a movie set and then have the task of stabbing and killing Barron Harkonnen. Good luck casting department.Another way that Denis elected to make the film more accessible to modern audiences was with the portrayal of Fremen culture. While Herbert's novel meticulously details their strict customs and rituals, including the practice of water discipline and the importance of the sietch (Fremen underground dwellings), Villeneuve's adaptation opts for a more simplified approach that focuses more on showing us that the Fremen adapted to the desert without telling us how to everything. Which for a film, is almost always the correct approach. The film emphasizes themes of unity, cooperation, and resistance against oppression, showcasing the Fremen as a fiercely independent and resourceful people. But the biggest thing that the film changes about Fremen culture is that they portray the Fremen as a society where men and women are seen as equals. Whereas in the book, Paul goes through a ritualistic transfer of ownership after defeating Jamis in single combat acquiring his wife and children in the process. Purists will of course be upset with this alteration, but I think Denis made this change to make us empathize with the Fremen and highlight the contrast with outdated customs upheld by the Empire and the Bene Gesserit, such as the transfer of power through marriage, as seen with Princess Irulan. With the adaptation's alterations in mind, let's delve into the performances of the cast, who brought these reimagined characters to life on the screen.Timothy Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides was nothing short of remarkable. His every scream, every whispered command, felt like a visceral punch, thanks to the impeccable sound editing that transported us directly into the heart of Arrakis. It's almost as if Paul was wielding the Voice, compelling us to follow his every move. Paul emerges as a more relatable and empathetic figure, grappling with the weight of destiny and the burden of leadership. He finds himself torn between the survival of his people and the potential devastation of billions. The conflict between his personal desires and his duty to the Fremen, his family, and the entire universe is palpable in Chalamet's portrayal. This was the level of acting and writing I wish was present for Anakin Skywalker in the film Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. Thankfully, Matthew Stover's novelization of the film does the story justice and I can't recommend it enough for any Star Wars fan out there. It truly blows that film away.But anyway, back to Dune. Chalamet skillfully navigates Paul's journey, portraying him as a man trapped by fate, forced to confront his own mortality and the inevitable consequences of his actions. What sets Chalamet's performance apart is his ability to convey Paul's internal struggle and conflicting emotions. He portrays a character who must reconcile his own desires with the greater good, knowing that his choices will shape the fate of worlds. Ultimately, Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides elevates the character to new heights, imbuing him with humanity and complexity and I am excited to see where his character goes in the upcoming Dune Messiah movie.Austin Butler's Feyd Rautha practically leapt off the screen with intensity and I loved every scene that he was in. His portrayal of the Baron's lovely Feyd seamlessly embodied the ferocity and cunning nature of House Harkonnen, delivering a performance that leaves a lasting impression. From his commanding presence in the electrifying introduction on Giedi Prime to his pivotal role in the intricate plots of the Bene Gesserit, Butler captures the essence of Feyd's character with intensity and depth and he just looked like he was having the time of his life playing the sociopathic villain. Though as great as Austin Butler was, what truly makes the character of Feyd so memorable is the meticulous setup crafted by Denis Villeneuve. In the books, on top of being a monstrous figure, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen was heavily implied to be a pedophile that had a sexual preference for \"young men\" and was particularly attracted to his nephew Feyd. He explained to Feyd that all of his schemes and the chaos he unleashed was for Feyd to take over House Harkonnen and to ascend to the throne of the emperor. This intricate web of \"plans within plans\" adds depth to the Baron's character, positioning him as a master manipulator to set Feyd Rautha up as a rival for Paul. While the book delves deeper into the nuances of the Baron,'s character, the film amplifies Feyd Rautha's threat, portraying him as a significant player in the power dynamics of the Dune universe.Prior to the audience's introduction Feyd, we see Princess Irulan having a conversation with the Reverend Mother shedding light on the intricate power dynamics at play, revealing the Bene Gesserit's plan for the succession to the throne. Irulan learns that the only way for the Shaddam family to retain power is through marriage. She is presented with two potential suitors: Paul, whom the Bene Gesserit are determined to prevent from ascending, and Feyd Rautha, whom Irulan protests is a sociopath. However, the Bene Gesserit are undeterred by Feyd's character flaws. They are solely interested in determining if he can be controlled because they know that they cannot control Paul.Enter Giedi Prime: the planet with a Black Sun that absorbs all color. The scene on Giedi Prime is a masterclass in visual storytelling. Shot with infrared cameras to emphasize the stark brutality of the Harkonnen home world, it immerses viewers in a world of darkness and danger. Amidst this backdrop, Feyd Rautha's character shines, embracing the challenge of combat with a sociopathic zeal. His fight is not just a display of physical prowess but a testament to his formidable nature and unyielding determination. Feyd relished every moment of the brutal combat, showcasing a level of derangement that even for a Harkonnen was chillingly unique.After the battle was over, we encounter the steadfast Lady Fenring, a stark contrast to the defiant Lady Jessica. Where Jessica chose to defy the Bene Gesserit's plans by bearing a son, Paul, Lady Fenring embodies unwavering dedication to their schemes. Her relentless commitment to the Bene Gesserit cause stands in sharp contrast to Jessica's independent spirit and serves the purpose of letting the audience know of how deep the Bene Gesserit's manipulative influence goes.Meanwhile, the scene culminates in a crucial revelation: the realization that Feyd Rautha has the potential to be a candidate for the Kwisatz Haderach! This revelation was brought to light by his successful passage of the Gom Jabbar test. Additionally, Lady Fenring being impregnated by Feyd, and following the Revernd Mother's explicit instructions to ensure that the baby was a girl, ensures the continuation of the Harkonnen lineage as they, the Bene Gesserit, desire thus solidifying the Bene Gesserit's influence behind.\n",

The love story played well and I'd expect they add a little more if they do a director's cut or something.Cinematography was epic like the previous film 🎥Acting was great and it was nice to see the diversity in actors.The whole design of the film with all its visuals, costumes, sound design, stunts and choreography, set design, etc., etc., were fantastic.The \"Narrating\" was done properly and not distracting.I'm honestly not sure how they can top this one.P.

            "Document 702 (Score: 0.0289): Dune Part Two is the sequel to the first Dune film by director Denis Villeneuve, which was released in 2021. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) has now joined the Fremen group. Here he tries to learn about their customs such as their handling of the sandworms. Paul seeks revenge on the conspirators who destroyed his family. With Chani (Zendaya) at his side, Paul goes into battle against enemy troops who serve the Emperor (Christopher Walken). This sequel, three years later, immediately picks up where the first part ended. This first part was well received by most as an improved start to the film adaptations of the Dune story. Previous film adaptations turned out less well, because the story of the Dune books is quite a large and complicated story. With Denis Villeneuve's first part he managed to properly introduce the Dune world and build it up with the political struggle between the different groups. With this second film he focuses more on the customs and beliefs of the Fremen group, who think they can defeat the enemy through a more religious approach. Furthermore, the relationship between Paul and Chani is also developed a bit more, but there are some rushed moments. However, with this second part, many things have to be explained and built upon, which means that there are some long-winded moments in this second part. Compared to the first part, this second part has more room for action scenes, which increases the pace and tension slightly. Furthermore, it remains more of a political battle between different groups and houses, which fight each other more strategically than really physically. In contrast to the first part, things in this second part feel more rushed. Like the relationship between Paul and Chani. The aspect of the earthworms and how the Fremen handle and ride the creatures is also explained in a somewhat hasty manner, so it is not always clear. Denis Villeneuve once again provides beautiful visual images of the different worlds and areas from the Dune books. Together with photography director Greig Fraser, they ensure that the images appear beautiful, creative and credible. By adapting the Dune story from the first book of the series into two films, Denis Villeneuve has given himself and his cast members more space to make something good and beautiful out of the film adaptation. This also gives the actors more space to develop their characters and evolve with the time they get in the films. Timothée Chalamet is thus given the opportunity to develop his character from an exploring newcomer into someone who tries to avenge the harm done to his family. Furthermore, he tries to be a savior for the different groups and tries to get them back into balance. Compared to the first part, Zendaya is given more time and space in this second part to develop her character more and work on the chemistry and relationship she has with Timothée Chalamet, his character. However, this relationship can seem a bit rushed, which means it cannot always remain so believable for every viewer. Of the new cast members, Austin Butler steals the most scenes as a dangerous warrior of the enemy army, but he and his character could have been given a little more time and development. Other well-known actors such as Josh Brolin, Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken play their roles well and appropriately, but unfortunately do not have such major roles in this second Dune film.\n",

            "Document 552 (Score: 0.0277): \"Dune: Part 2\" had the weight of expectation upon its shoulders, following the success of its predecessor. However, this highly anticipated sequel falls short of achieving the same level of excellence. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the film struggles with uneven pacing, lackluster character development, and a narrative that feels rushed and heavy-handed.One of the glaring issues with \"Dune: Part 2\" is its pacing, which oscillates between dragging in the middle third and rushing through the final third. The film spends too much time on inconsequential events, leaving little room for character arcs to develop organically. Paul's transformation from a reluctant leader to a megalomaniac zealot feels particularly rushed and lacking in depth, robbing the audience of the opportunity to truly empathize with his journey. Having attended a late evening showing there were times I was actually checking my watch, unbelievably so, but I have to admit myself bored particularly past the first hour mark.Rather than feeling a drama play out in real time, we're simply told drama 'is' playing out. Its a subtle but important difference, but one which needs to be acknowledged. Unfortunately there is no sense of stakes here, instead its just characters accomplishing one task after the other until Paul can eventually become 'The Messiah'. At no point did I ever feel this was under threat, yet apparently according to what the characters are saying, that's EXACTLY how I should be feeling.Another one of my main complaints was the love story between Paul and Chani, with it feeling forced and clichéd to the nth degree. The lack of chemistry between the two actors was distracting and the on-again, off-again nature of their romance detracted from the emotional weight their relationship is apparently supposed to carry. It's a narrative thread that we've seen countless times before, yet done better in other movies, leaving viewers feeling indifferent rather than invested; I had no real reason to care about these two, other than I was told I was supposed to by the plot. We can call Dune Part 2 a masterpiece all we want, but when the main romance and arguably main backdrop of the second installment feels corny, then we know we've got problems.The introduction of Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha character also feels unnecessary and cartoonish. His role usurps that of Dave Bautista's Beast Rabban from the world-building of the first film, only to be disposed of by the end of the sequel. This decision undermines the tension that could and probably SHOULD have been built with Bautista's character and leaves audiences questioning the purpose of Butler's inclusion. Feyd Rautha felt 'evil for the sake of evil' and a mere device to give the hero's of Paul and Chani something to aim at, whilst not actually threatening to alter the plot.Despite these shortcomings, \"Dune: Part 2\" does have its strengths, particularly in its visual effects, framing, and atmosphere. Denis Villeneuve once again proves himself a master of his craft, creating stunning visuals that transport audiences to the world of Arrakis. However, these moments of visual brilliance can sometimes feel overindulgent, with scenes of desert landscapes and thumpers dragging on for longer than necessary. Credit where credit is due however....Ultimately, \"Dune: Part 2\" fails to deliver a satisfying payoff, with the Emperor's defeat feeling anticlimactic and Christopher Walken's portrayal lacking the gravitas it deserves. While the film runs for a lengthy time, almost none of it is given towards developing his character and giving the audience a reason to care about his potential affect and inclusion in the narrative. Unfortunately he just exists here as a confused looking old man, and the film is poorer for it.In conclusion, \"Dune: Part 2\" is a visually impressive but a narratively underwhelming sequel. While it may have been hailed as a masterpiece by some, it ultimately fails to live up to its potential. Those seeking to immerse themselves in the world of \"Dune\" would be better off sticking to the books, as the film leaves much to be desired, particularly given its lengthy runtime. As a non book reader myself, I sure know where I'll be heading now to get my Dune fix.\n",
            "Document 348 (Score: 0.0275): This is a truly amazing movie that showcases Villeneuve's artistry on multiple levels. Many storytelling choices that deviate from the book were actually smart, so a lot of thought definitely went into the script. But somehow the big picture got lost.What I found very evocative in the first Dune film by Villeneuve was Paul's struggle with his mother's vision for his life. It formed a kind of emotional core in the movie which suited the format perfectly. When you spend 2-3 hours in the cinema, you expect a certain story arc.This theme is obviously also a major red thread in the books and so continues in Part Two. But all the spectacular imagery, music and ethos does not make up for the rather wooden character development of Paul. Timothée Chamalet is a fantastic actor so you follow the story anyway. The film would have been so much stronger though if his evolution from troubled teen to messianic warlord were just a little more carefully crafted in the script.This shortcoming is also visible in Paul's relationship with Chani. On many levels their romance is very plausible and compelling. Towards the end of the film, the mystery wrapped around Paul's destiny inevitably comes between them. But there is so much storytelling potential in this emotional timebomb that just seems to fall flat.Besides these and other minor flaws, there are so many reasons to see this film. Some of my favorite moments are delivered by the actors Rebecca Ferguson (Lady Jessica), Zendaya (Chani), Stellan Skårsgard (Baron Harkonnen) and the chilling Austin Butler (Feyd-Rautha).\n",

This is one of the few movies that I didn't try to control my expectations beforehand and it still surpassed them in many ways.\"Power over spice is power over all\"- that kinda turned out to be a lie at the end. As The movie starts, I felt an immediate sense of tension through its score. It's a cinematic experience; I can't imagine feeling the same lying at home in bed, watching in headphones. The resonating vibrations as the sounds reverberate through the theater created an epic atmosphere.When Part One came out people said it was \"game of thrones in space\", I wasn't really taken by that as much, especially since people said the same about Apple TV's Foundation series. So I just enjoyed the movie as Dune and bore no comparisons. After watching part two however I see it; the world building, the politics, the epic grandeur of it all.However, the first half of Dune Part Two is pretty grounded and calm, delving into the lives of the Fremen. It almost feels like two distinct movies, the first half intricately setting the stage for the climactic third act and reinforcing character connections established in Dune Part One. Unlike the Part One's focus on lore, this movie is more devotion-driven, also resembling a political narrative, especially knowing of the hidden puppeteers behind the empire. The result appears to be an intricate web of schemes involving the empire, the witch-advisor women(can't spell their names lol), and the Baron's family. Despite the emperor's pulling the strings, the Baron's family still felt like main antagonist to me.The second half of the movie is where we see the epic scale of dune. The movies not quick paced but you couldn't tell, I was absolutely immersed in it.I absolutely loved the kind \"The mahdi is too humble to say he is the mahdi.\" Theatre burst out in laughter. It felt weird, I wasn't expecting any humour. It's funnier than I expected. More lively than the first Dune movie. I'd already seen the Usul-worm-riding scene from the Dune Part One reopening bonus content. I was still just as excited and it didn't spoil a thing.The visual brilliance, as expected was stunning, elevating every aspect. The authenticity of the scenes made it feel as if characters were immersed in the environment, rather than merely placed against a green screen. I loved the portrayal of time passing through Paul's changing eyes; the longer he stays the bluer his eyes get. Despite how lively it is, the plot, while progressing at a measured pace, remains engaging, drawing attention away from its deliberate slowness. It has much more action, the battles were absolutely epic, I feel like they could have been longer but they still captivated me.Jessica disappears for a while, but just when I thought that, she showed up. Other than Paul and Zendeya, the rest of the cast doesn't really get as much screen time as you'd think. I loved the baby/embryo/featus scenes. Batista with no mask in the desert while his whole team's suited up was badass. I love him in darker roles, although I think some moments felt overly animated. But it gave an effective contrast to Austin Butler though, I couldn't wait to see what his character was like. Very fierce, intimidating and psycho. The girl shivering with the plate in her hands before the gladiator games made me chuckle. Butler did also sound like the baron at times.Dune: Part Two stands steady on its own, it felt complete compared to the more introductory feel of Part One. Despite this, I still felt like it lays groundwork for Dune: Part Three/Messiah, leaving a sense of setup. The movie, while feeling like a precursor, still manages to provide a more conclusive ending. I also think you should watch Part One first, if that has to be said; and the prospect of a back-to-back viewing sounds like a fun afternoon.One thing I can complain about is Stilger. I have mixed feelings. In Part One, Javier was fierce and was my favorite character, in this movie though he's depicted as a religious fanatic for the most part. It was done well, but I still miss the Stilgar who walked up to Duke Leto Atreides with no disregard. This felt like a different person, still fierce, just different.Loved Austin butler though, I wasn't sure what to expect as I tried my best to avoid trailers and teasers apart from the Dune part one bonus content. That short lady in charge of extracting 'the water of life' had some insane calves on her, I'm extremely jealous.While I was initially not convinced about Timothée Chalamet as the lead, he truly owns the role in the sequel, displayed acting facets I'd not seen before from him. The movie essentially unfolds as Paul Atreides' coming-of-age story, with Zendaya delivering an amazing performance. The first act, focusing on their love story, adds depth to the events at the movie's end. Zendaya's portrayal transcends the typical love story, I hope her role extends into Dune: Messiah, and hopefully adds further complexity to her character.We see Paul undergo some transformations. From being the son of royalty to experiencing love, the narrative takes a surprising turn when he assumes authority in the third act. Although I liked it, it felt a bit rushed. But, I found solace/logic with the \"water of life\" spiritual poison, where drinking it resulted in a profound shift in your personality. The contrast between the before and after versions of Paul, as well as Jessica, is striking so it kinda made sense to me.I think watching this movie at home won't do it justice, it's clearly made for the big screens if you can. It's pretty epic and I think it'll remain memorable as one of 2024's best movies, despite only being February. I absolutely loved it.\n",

Probably got more interesting after Austin Butler's character rolled in, honestly. Pacing. I think the pacing was weird as they could've fleshed out the relationships, training, and yeah... basically the story more. It's just not convincing compared to the first movie. I didn't feel much for the characters nor did I care for them. I didn't even care for Chani and Paul's romance. And it's like wow.. Paul is already attempting to ride the worm? It's so dangerous and he's already succeeded on his first attempt. He's THAT gifted. There were mentions of training but really no show. I mean, Paul was basically told to survive through the dessert as a test and learns how to sand walk better but that's... it. The movie simply shows the major parts but nothing much in between to build it up. It was also like watching two different movies in one and now the \"good\" side is gonna ambush and fight the \"bad\" side.

I wonder how much the lack of chemistry between the two main characters played into why this movie was rushed. Those two may be decent actors in other things, but they were not good in this, especially the actress that plays Chani, she was awful.At the end of the day the Sci-Fy Channel version is the best, and it is not even close, because they actually liked Dune as Frank Herbert wrote it, and overall stuck to his story.

            "Document 16 (Score: 0.0263): It was a visual spectacle and refreshingly it lived up to and beyond the hype.However, for me there was a niggling itch through the movie. Something about Chani's character that bothered me and only grew as the movie progressed.I googled to see if others shared this feeling, all I could find was praise for the character. However there was consensus that she was written very different from the book.I finally found an article that helped describe the disconnect I felt with ChaniThe following is not my writing and all credit is given to Kara Kennedy - \" ...Herbert's novel Dune, Chani has a range of roles and avenues of strength, influence, and power. She becomes Paul's love but begins as the young woman who introduces him to a foreign desert land in his visions and the one who guides him as he integrates into the Fremen community. She is a fierce young fighter as well as a religious leader in her role as Sayyadina, standing apart from Paul to oversee the cultural rites. She is a young mother who finally wins the approval of her child's Bene Gesserit grandmother, Jessica, and saves Paul from a long coma. She is wise enough to understand the political necessities of Paul legally marrying a princess and trusted by him to negotiate the marriage contract.Chani's attachment to Paul is an important part of the story, but it does not reduce her to being a simple, one-dimensional female character. Chani is an essential window into Fremen culture. Her multi-faceted character challenges stereotypes about women of faith and women in non-Western cultures that continue to be debated about in the real world.Meanwhile, the films-Dune: Part One and especially Dune: Part Two-make substantial changes to Chani's character in the name of making her more independent, which end up making her more stereotypically masculine. She is mainly a fighter who has a fling with Paul. She is not a mother and not a religious figure, instead rejecting any association with religious beliefs or practices. She is almost a second Jamis except that she has a brief romantic entanglement with Paul.Chani's disavowal of the religious elements in her culture arguably represents a contemporary, Western, cynical view taking over the story; that religion must be purged to empower the individual, to free women from their shackles. This change in Chani's character appears to be intended to make her more free and complex, because she's not a follower and she doesn't believe. She can be dismissive of Paul and sees little to learn from him. Their relationship is then not a mutual exchange, a partnership, but something she has to turn aside from to be independent.The underlying message is that if Chani were a woman of faith like in the book, she couldn't be an interesting, complex character, just a follower who's oppressed. The takeaway is that the Fremen's religious system is bad because it was influenced by outsiders. That faith makes people weak and that being a fighter and killer is preferable to being like the women who live in the sietches, wear headscarves, and discuss religious ideas, or who carry the tribe's ancestors in their bodies.Chani may also reflect a deeper fear in the increasingly secular West about the power of religion in the 21st century. It is possible that the idea in Dune of an oppressed group militarily united under a religious banner, drawing strength from a belief in something greater than themselves, is still too much to put on screen in an adaptation, especially given the book's Middle Eastern influences. If viewers need to be reassured that not everyone believes, that there is division, that someone is the rational one to turn away from the 'fundamentalists,' then Chani offers this. She is the contrasting perspective, the voice of so-called reason, who questions the religious indoctrination.But ultimately, the considerable changes made to Chani's character for Denis Villeneuve's film adaptations alienate her from her lover and her culture and strip her of the many roles she has in the book. Any complexity gained by her skepticism is offset by the loss of her influence and authority and her place in her community. Chani's depiction in the films worryingly suggests that the price of being an independent woman means being faithless and alone.\"\n",

Again the movie was merciless, if you had not read the books you would be lost from the start as no explanation was offered, and perhaps should go home at this point lolPart 2 of the book is about the coming true of the Arakan prophecy of a messiah that will lead the fremen to a \"green paradise\". So it is dark and religiously \"top heavy\", and so was this movie. A brooding dark serious movie with Paul and Jessica struggling with their inner demons for most of the time and tons of set piece Marshall combats. No gags here!Mr Villineuve again achieved the impossible by bringing to life this most complex of novels for the fans and it was really quite brilliant and needs to be watched numerous times.Without undermining the brilliant acting from the cast, Timothee Chalamet was outstanding in his ability to command the screen and convey we were in the presence of a messiah, he was never off the screen and it was deeply moving. The element about Paul being able to see backwards and forwards in time, whilst mentioned was not demonstrated really very effectively. Secondly, we needed more demonstration of the voice in its subtleties.There were several divergences from the book, Paul's integration into the Fremen took 3 years and Alia was born with the memories of her ancestors and excellent with a knife, this seemed to happened over a summer in the movie. Secondly Chani stands by Paul's side throughout even through a political marriage, the movie diverges from this. However Mr Villeneuve condensed the spirit of the book without diluting its impetus and Frank Herbert's intentions were respected.Perhaps more controversial, and of course it's my opinion, there was, unfortunately, to my mind, one glaring problem, there just was no on-screen chemistry between Timothee and Zendaya, it just didn't work, also her acting grated, she seemed to have attended the AB school of acting, using just 2 faces that conveyed petulance, irritation or indeed trapped wind! She just overworked most of it as if it was for TV, we all know, for movie acting \"less is more\", she looked the part, but there just was just no sexual frisson, and the accent was too american, everyone else modified their to be from \"nowhere\" exactly, so she was miscast. I have seen this actress now in Spider-Man, Euphoria and now this, she lacks thespianic skills to convey anything more than the superficial, just no heft! Florence Pugh would have made a better Chani as that lady has the skills when she's humble!I thought Austin Butler was brilliant as the evil nephew, bulked up and without eyebrows, and the teeth, it was a terrific transformation and I love it!The music was amazing throughout as were the worms and battle sequences, the CGI set a new standard in meticulous and seamingless continuity, we were there, we had a parched throat and sand in our faces, I did the sand walk back to the underground lol!This is, of course a must see, and I'm giving it a 9 outta 10, brilliant except for the romantic elements, pathetic, and passionless!\n",

Either you watched - and loved - the first part, in which case you have already gone out and seen it. Or...you didn't like the first part (or didn't watch it), in which case you are not going to the Cineplex to check out the sequel.If you ARE going to see this film, the BankofMarquis strongly recommends you see it in theaters with the best sound and largest screen possible...for 2 reasons.Reason 1: This film is visually and audibly stunning. It is a feast for the eyes and ears. Director Villeneuve (and all involved in the production, costume, sound and Fx design) have topped the very high bar they set for themselves with the first Dune and expect this film to rake in ALL of these types of awards come next Oscars' season. They visually (and audibly) credibly present new worlds in such a way that you are sure that the movie was filmed on location when (in fact) it is all pretty much green sky. An amazing technical achievementReason 2: It's a good thing that this film is visually and audibly stunning, because the storyline itself, is rather boring and somewhat complex. This is the fault of the source novel as Dune (and it's sequels) are just as interested in the politics and back room dealings of how you turn a hero into a Messiah (with a ton of backstory and plot development thought by the characters - never a good way to present a movie). So you will want to watch this in a theater so you can keep focused on the plot (as opposed to at home where you will be tempted to pick up your phone, pet the dog, go make a sandwich etc.) and not miss some of the intricacies.Caught between Reason 1 and Reason 2 are a laundry list of performers and performances that are struggling to match the technical achievements of Dune: Part Two while acting against a green screen with some long, boring speeches and some very clunky dialogue.Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson and Charlotte Rampling all return from the first part and they are \"just fine\", not really elevating things, but not bringing them down either. They gamely bring their best to a rather difficult and thankless job.Thank goodness Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are back as their characters bring some life and energy to the proceedings while Florence Pugh, Dave Bautista, Lea Seydoux, Stellan Skarsgard and (especially) Christopher Walken (!) are wasted in their roles, really being more of a piece of furniture to move around rather than anything that represents an interesting character.Only Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha brings new excitement to the 2nd half of this 2 hour and 40 minute epic and, by that point in this film, it is much needed.Come to DUNE: PART TWO for the visual and sound achievements and stay for...the visual and sound achievements - and the setup to the inevitable sequel.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)\n",

Continuing almost directly after the first part, the film reinvites viewers to the atmospheric, entrancing world of Arrakis in the shoes of Paul, now accompanied with the Fremen. Also complementing the film is the score. This soundtrack, composed by Hans Zimmer, enhances the film's overall mood; even so, it is not a particularly memorable one. The cinematography is one of the picture's greatest highlights, providing stunning visuals that are certainly going to be on display for those 8K televisions on sale. The first act is mysterious and tense. The set pieces and plot points are both otherworldly and eerie. It glues one's eyes to the screen, and refuses to let them go.Character development is a large focus throughout the film and the world of Arrakis is further explored. Timothee Chalamet is talented in the lead role, giving in convincing emotion without going overboard. Zendaya plays the role of Chani, though her portrayal here is similar to another character she played, Michelle Watson. Several other A-list actors light the screen as well. Austin Butler in particular does a phenomenal job as an incredibly frightening villain. Stellan Skarsgård's talent as the Baron also returns, with the same sinister energy found in the preceding film. The remaining actors do a well job at their roles, but are lacking in screen time to give too much of an impression.With the above-average acting, the appropriate score, and the exceptional cinematography, the first two hours are excellent! The last thirty minutes, unfortunately, are a weak point. The pacing is thrice in speed and unspecified aspects feel lazier than they should. This was also a problem in its 1965 source material, and it is a shame to see no improvement in the movie released nearly sixty years after. It is no dealbreaker; even so, it does hamper the film's overall quality by no small margin.Dune: Part Two - 74/100\n",

Of course if you have seen part one some elements will be that much easier to grasp.

On a couple of occasions I resisted the temptation, to stand up and cheer. It's extremely rare for any film to make me feel that way no matter how good.Timothy Chalamet has never been better, his performance totally befitting the part of Paul.The studio were right to delay release so the cast could promote it. It deserves to be seen by a wide audience and not just sci-fi fans and the cast and crew should be rightly proud of the achievement, a sold out theatre in the middle of a weekday afternoon tells you everything.

The Fremen have these OP laser guns but are still relying on hand to hand combat?I think the movie could also have been a little more helpful to those of us who haven't read the books by reiterating some of the lore and rules of the Dune universe.\n",

The complex thoughts and writing from the novel is carried out beautifully as the story switches out between separate planets and settings, and ultimately creating different cinematic experiences every half hour or so.Focusing less on comparisons around the book, Dune Part Two feels unique to the first movie. Regarding their similarities of how Part Two upscales everything that Part One did right (and removed EVERY criticism I had with it), the pacing of Dune Part Two is crafted excellently.Each arc in the story is written and filmed like a Greek Epic, with Timothée Chalamet being your Heracles. Simple dialogues will distract you with beautiful sunsets and brutal battles immerse you with the sense of victory or the pain of loss.I especially was a fan of Austin Butler's performance as one of antagonists and his acting was downright horrific at times, when mere logic causes an advisor to have his throat slit due to Feyd's psychotic tendencies.Chalamet stepping up as a leader in his Hero's Journey is a transcendent experience, as he quickly transforms from bland, intelligent, and strong rich kid to a planning politician with a guide to his goals within his mind. Overall, Paul Atreidus becomes an actually interesting character.This movie had some unintentional comedic moments.

With meticulous attention to detail and stunning aesthetics, Villeneuve brings to life on the big screen the landscapes of an atypical universe.The film follows the story of Paul Atreides (portrayed by Timothée Chalamet), a young noble who becomes the key to crucial events as his family takes control of the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune, the only place in the universe where \"melange\" is found - a precious substance that affects the entire known world through its effects.With an impressive ensemble cast, including Rebecca Ferguson as Paul's mother, Lady Jessica, and Oscar Isaac as his father, Duke Leto Atreides, the film shapes its characters in a way that allows the audience to feel a deep connection with this fascinating world. Additionally, the performances of Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho and Dave Bautista as Glossu Rabban add an extra dimension of intensity and drama.Villeneuve uses his remarkable directing skills to build a tense atmosphere full of mystery and danger. The magnificent visuals and hypnotic soundtrack contribute to creating a captivating and memorable cinematic experience.The novel Dune, considered unfilmable and rightfully so, is somewhat minimalist in its portrayal, which might somewhat bother the \"purists\" of the book series, but the general impression is that Denis Villeneuve has done as much as possible in this regard given the constraints imposed by a film of maximum 3 hours.With a brisk pace and a well-constructed narrative, \"Dune II\" follows Paul's rise amidst the desert tribes and his exploration of his prophetic powers, as well as his confrontation with the imperial and political forces seeking to control him.Timothée Chalamet's performance is surprising, showing the complex evolution of his character as he discovers his true power and assumes his responsibilities as a leader. Meanwhile, the supporting characters continue to shine, and the remarkable acting performances of Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, the most successful so far, add depth and emotional tension.Visually, \"Dune II\" impresses with its epic battle scenes and stunning landscapes of the planet Arrakis, while the intense soundtrack contributes to amplifying the tense atmosphere.\"Dune I\" and \"Dune II\" represent not only two remarkable films but also an exceptional cinematic adaptation of a monumental literary work.Perhaps a bit more could have been done; my fundamental reproach is that Villeneuve did not even explain through a reference the fundamental premise of the universe he describes, namely the Butlerian Jihad (the war against machines), an event that explains why the Dune universe looks the way it does, why there are no AIs or even computers, what was the fundamental role of spice, what the Guild was, and why it needed this substance found only on Dune, and so forth.\n",

However, I just watched it out of curiosity because it looked promising and I didn't have the slightest clue what it was all about. But what excites me about this kind of movie is that it'll always get better every time you watch it again. Things become much clearer and that's when I hop on the Dune bandwagon, the sequel is just two times better in terms of, well basically everything.

I guess this is what it feels like to live in the '90s, '80s, or even '70s when genre-defining movies are born, such as Star Wars (because it's the same genre).So basically Part One is just an introduction to all the characters, motives, the center of the story, etc. Though I'd say it is a fair introduction rather than perfect because as I said before, it's definitely not an easy watch for everyone especially those who never read the book. As for the sequel, it really is a perfect continuation that takes us right back into the story and explores more about why it all happened in the first place. Both Paul's and Jessica's development are written perfectly without overlapping and leaving the other one weak as a result. The performances of the actors and actresses were just perfect, they played their parts perfectly. Though his screen time is short, Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha is definitely the one for me, he gave it all out and was completely unrecognizable.You know what, I'm out of words to describe just how good-looking this movie is from the technical standpoint.

That's how it's done, Denis.Well, enough with the good.The character development, aside from Paul and Chani, is altogether lacking. Jessica and Stilgar get some screen time, just to give the barest support the origin storyline. The Harkonnens (though rendered beautifully) are not just unidimensional. Vileneuve practically comes out and spells \"Unidimensional\" in black and white letters. Yes, they're brutes, we get it.The storyline is pretty much a mediocre love story. It's nice, not terrible, but it's just that. As a stand alone, it is an enjoyable - enough watch.

A superhuman, a demigod. A story of intrigue and plotting and plans within plans within plans.But Villeneuve's is a lackluster story of a a sort of fortune teller conning a few fundamentalists into following him.There is no awe - aside from that inspired by the visuals. And as result, there is no way to properly end this story.Unable to lean on the CGI, and unsupported by the underdeveloped story line, the final falls flat.\"I remember your Gom Jabbar. You remember Mine. I can kill you with one word\" Paul should have said. Words that could have sent a shiver down the viewer's spine.But perhaps, Villeneuve chose the pathetic \"Silence\" to avoid the viewer's puzzled looks. Remembert the What? What's Bene Gesserit anyway?In summary, this is not a masterpiece, but it's a decent movie with great visuals.

Building on the foundation laid in Part One, the action is bigger, bolder, and more thrilling. The sandworm battles are particularly impressive, showcasing the immense power and scale of these creatures. While the first half focuses heavily on world-building, the sequel delves deeper into character development. We see Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) grapple with his destiny, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) navigate the Fremen power dynamics, and Chani (Zendaya) emerge as a strong voice of reason. The cast delivers strong performances across the board. Chalamet continues to impress as the conflicted Paul, while Ferguson brings depth and complexity to Lady Jessica. Zendaya shines with her nuanced portrayal of Chani, and the supporting cast, including Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin, adds further weight to the narrative.The film's first half feels rushed at times, cramming in a lot of exposition to catch viewers up on plot points left unresolved in Part One. This can be jarring for those unfamiliar with the source material. While visually stunning, the film struggles to match the emotional weight of the first installment. The complex themes of power, destiny, and ecological balance are present, but not fully explored. The film ends on a cliffhanger, setting the stage for a potential third part.

That speech and ending had me have insane amount of goosebumps and tears. Especially with that Hans Zimmer score, it's one of the best scores in movies ever. It's Hans's best work so far. I feel like each song stuck to a title, being 'Desert Spring'. I felt goosebumps with any score. This movie showed how you introduce a villain, you do not go just saying, \"Oh No!

You can see how DV made this especially for IMAX, with the whole movie being shot with IMAX digital cameras. The cinematography done in this is excellent, acting done was also incredible with Timothee Chalamet and Javier Bardem. Zendaya on the other hand can feel a little bit weird as in the book she wasn't this rebel but I can understand how DV makes Zendaya like this because Frank Herbert wanted Paul to be an anti-hero but changing the script a bit can fully convey the message of Paul being an anti-hero.Overall, I want to watch this again as soon as it comes back in IMAX for the third time, but I will look for IMAX GT, to get the full immersive experience of IMAX, I do not want to watch this online because the immersive experience of Dune will be gone as the screen is just too small, even though I have DTS sound system at home.

It was the best cinema experience I've ever had and I fully believe that you will love it too.If anyone else enjoys Timothee Chalamet's acting, I would also recommend The King (2019). He was great in that as Henry V and I'm sure his performance contributed to his casting in Dune (2021).However, I can see why some people were frustrated by the plot. Having never read the book, I don't know the full extent of the changes but I do understand that it was deemed \"unfilmable\" back in 1984 when the first attempt was released. (Which reminds me a bit of a serious take on Flash Gordon or something.) Anyway, this (as well as Part 1) are very streamlined. It feels fast-paced and eventful. Which I really enjoyed as I didn't need everything. The world-building was enough but, if you are looking for a faithful adaptation, this might not be what you are looking for. I don't know.I guess one issue I had was that the discussion of Paul as the Lisan-Al-Gaib reminded me of the discussion of Brian as the Messiah in Life of Brian. Which I personally found to be hilarious, and it felt like a deliberate homage as the actors seemed to find it funny when they were speaking the lines, but it did take me out of the story a little when I watched it at home.Finally, when I saw this at home on the \"small screen\" I really enjoyed it. However, it was simply not the same. All of the visuals were limited by comparison and while I refer to it as the \"small screen\" this was on a relatively large screen. (I own a projector that was probably projecting somewhere around 80\").As a result, while I will advise that you see this film in any format that is available to you but (if you can) keep an eye on any cinema / IMAX re-releases.

It's bigger, boulder and slightly better than its predecessor. This movie concludes the first movie in a very satisfying way as you keep rooting for Paul in his revenge quest and rise to power.This movie has more action scenes, explosions and violence than the first film but keeps the same tone in the world building, mysticism and grounded character moments.Visually and technically this movie is masterpiece.There are some scenes that will stay with you even after the credits roll, wanting to go see the film again just to relive the spectacle you just witnessed (those who've seen it, you know which scenes I'm talking about...). CGI is also used sparingly just to amplify the screenplay in large scenes.Direction and writing of this movie is top notch and satisfying for the viewer. The movie creates tension in the beginning and peaks strongly towards the end (unlike Oppenheimer). There are no pacing issues.Storywise the movie succeeds in the message its trying to deliver thanks to the cast and especially Timothée Calamet's strong performance. I was worried that Paul Atreides' journey of becoming the chosen \"jihad messiah\" would not be believable at all, given the main actors young age. To my surprise this was all done very well and Timothée Calamet managed to shift his characters personality in a drastic way, which made him seem like a totally different person at the end, the kind of fanatic leader the masses would follow. This is partly for the credit of the rest of the cast that genuinely seem to worship and uplift the young man to power.However, there are some minor faults in this movie but only minor since the movie could have been even better and elevated into perfection with only a few fixes in my opinion.Firstly, the events of the movie and planet Arrakis are supposed to control the fate of the entire universe. Sadly the film doesn't make us feel this intergalactic conflict since it focuses only on the two houses, Harkonnen and Atreides. Events take place mainly on Arrakis and the world isn't expanded much. This could've been fixed with just extra 5 - 10 minutes by showing us a few different planets, cultures and other great houses reacting to the conflict or talking about it in some manner. Sadly we dont have a director's cut to show us what could've been.Secondly, the movie feels somewhat one dimensional because of the interplay of the story and the music. Although fantastic, Hans Zimmer's score is quite loud and pushes the audience to feel the \"epicness\" \"darkness\" and sense of \"doom\" to the point of exhaustion throughout the 3 hour runtime. There aren't enough calm and beautiful moments and gentle musical pieces to balance out these emotions, other than a few between Chani and Paul.Other movies of this genre (e.g. Star Wars, Interstellar) manage to evoke many different emotions throughout the film. But since this movie is mainly about revenge, power and conquest the score suits the plot well. But in the end the movie evokes only one kind of emotion with its themes and music to complement it. This could've been fixed with maybe revisiting Paul's early family life in flashbacks or something else that's tonally different to the main feel of the movie. For these reasons I must say I felt a sleight sense of emptiness after leaving the theatre.Despite these few critiques, the movie succeeds on every front and brings home the main theme of revenge and justice in a very satisfying way for the audience and concludes the setup in the first installment very well. Dune Part 2 is an epic visual masterpiece and will remain as one of the greatest Sci-fi films of this generation.Rating: 8,5 stars.\n",

It absolutely surpasses the already spectacular first part. It's a lot more fast paced, with a ton more action. And since we got most of the heavy exposition out of the way in Part One, the film now mostly focuses on letting the visuals tell the story. And what a story it is. Not only is it an awesome sci-fi epic, not only is it a cool revenge tale, but it's the saga of our main character's rise to power coupled with his fall from grace. Paul's journey from refusing to become the Lisan Al Gaib to embracing the moniker and using it to suit his needs is as captivating as it is intense.The cast does an even better job than the first film. Timothy Chalamet, who was a little bland in Part One, slowly grows into a terrifying presence who perfectly sells Paul's descent into madness. He has solid chemistry with Chani and Zendaya does a great job displaying her love for him and sadness at what he becomes. Javier Bardem goes a little over the top in his belief in Paul, but I never doubt his passion and faith. The new characters are fantastic: Christopher Walken is fun as always as the Emperor and Austin Butler is terrifying as Feyd-Rautha. But, the real star is Rebecca Ferguson. Her development is just as captivating as Paul's and she is downright scary at times.Visually, the film blows me away. The taste we got of Arrakis in Part One is fully realized here. The Fremen culture is fully explored, shown through Paul and Jessica's eyes as outsiders, and presented through stellar sets. The sound, music, directing, and cinematography are all fantastic. The color scheme runs the full gambit from the red and brown of Arrakis to the black, white, and grey of the villains' world. This is also the first film I saw in IMAX where the sound actually lived up to its reputation.Overall, Dune Part Two was more than worth the wait. I loved every second of it and you can bet I have every intention of buying it when it comes out on Blu-Ray. As for Dune: Messiah, whenever Denis Villeneuve makes it, I'll be right there in the theater to enjoy.\n",

Over the course of the story, he changes from a likable kid into something more cosmic and inhuman, and that might be a problem for the audience, since stories usually need a relatable character. Timothée Chalamet manages this transition skillfully and believably but it still leaves the audience without their relatable character.Villeneuve seems to have hit on an ideal solution: beef up the role of Chani so that she becomes that relatable character. I can already envision her role in the third movie of the trilogy, which no doubt is already being planned given the huge box office success of this movie.This is a big departure from the books but the third movie is going to have to be more of Villeneuve's invention that the first two were, anyway.\n",

The movie is worse than horrible because it's been flushed out of production with no second thought purely so the investors can take their bag and move on.Dune is quite literally the complete opposite of this. The developers have a deep connection to the source material, and their devotion is crystal clear.Dune: Part 2 is a culmination of hard work, dedication, commitment and the proper use of narrative storytelling and structure. There are no points in this movie where one may 'fall asleep' which was where the first movie fell off.The way in which the movie has been structured and presented allows the viewer to completely immerse themselves, making them feel like they are within the world of Dune itself, watching events play out as a warrior along Paul's side or one of his religious fanatics.The movie, in most senses, actually moves TOO fast - which may hurt the interpretation of what's presented (because most moviegoers are far too used to the poor and eye-candy structure of most current action films). But, nonetheless, if you pay proper attention and try your best to understand, you probably will.On a side note, this movie couldn't have achieved what it has without its predecessor. Many have forgotten what happened in the first instalment because of its failure to properly entertain the audience, but after breaking down the first film you can see the dependance the sequel has to the first film.One last point, this movie would not be the achievement that it is without its stunningly beautiful use of soundtrack and CGI.This film goes above and beyond in the way it integrates the music with narrative tension and overall impact. It would not have been as jaw-dropping without Hanz Zimmer's S-tier performance and love of composition - should i even mention how well he immerses himself into the film's universe to produce such fitting and unique sound?Additionally, this film stands as a manual on how to properly use CGI and stage control. It goes against the current methods of using animation to please the eye, and yet, showed us things more stunning and impactful than the poorly rendered scenes presented by studios such as Marvel and Sony that everyone seems to appreciate way too much.Control over production, is control over impact!\n",

            "Document 130 (Score: 0.0195): An absolutely gorgeous, austere piece of film. Denis Villeneuve is serving up some of the most majestic of scientific fiction images we've seen on the 21st century cinema screen. It's impossible to say this a bad film or adaptation.Villeneuve treats each shot as if it were a painting. Every design choice seems handed down through millennia of alternative human history, from arcane hieroglyphics to a slew of creative masks and veils meant to conceal the faces of those manipulating the levers of power, nearly all of them women.Herbert's dense novel can be a daunting slog for the average reader, who can't tell a Sandworm from a Sardaukar - which is one of the reasons Villeneuve's approach felt like such a breakthrough: It pared the mythology down to something manageable, serving up visceral action set-pieces at regular intervals. The movie air-dropped audiences in a world where foreign customs, politics and technology had long been established, never letting the complexity of those elements slow down the storytelling.That's not to say Villeneuve's \"Dune\" movies are fast-paced. Channeling the austerity of Andrei Tarkovsky at times, the director takes nearly five hours to cover what David Lynch did in just slightly more than two (though iconic in some respects, the now badly dated 1984 version barely scratched the surface of Herbert's concerns). If \"Part Two\" feels slow in places, it's because Villeneuve takes time to develop the connection between characters, as in a handful of scenes dedicated to Fremen warrior Chani (Zendaya) and Paul, aka Muad'Dib (or Usul), whose undeniable attraction doesn't align with Jessica's plans for her son.In many ways overcomes some of the weakness of the first (pacing overall felt better, obviously less setup, the score is used more sparingly in a way that allows many more moments breathe). But still suffers from the necessity of cramming so much story into such a small space. Some beats that need to feel pivotal, felt rushed to me and there's not much room for character performance to do the heavy lifting. You hardly notice though because you're inside a such stunningly realized alien landscape for the length, with so much to look at and take in. I enjoyed every moment and can't wait to revisit it soon.Audience will find in Villeneuve's multipart saga a satisfaction few films can offer. It's an enormous gamble, given the expense of creating at this scale, and a vote of confidence in cinema, which still hasn't recovered to the pre-pandemic level at play when the franchise was conceived. The fate of far more than Arrakis is riding on \"Dune.\"\n",

Director Denis Villeneuve has outdone himself, weaving a tapestry so rich in detail and emotion that it's hard not to be completely engulfed by the world of Arrakis.The narrative depth in this sequel is profound, striking a perfect balance between the political intrigue, personal vendettas, and the overarching battle for control of the spice. The storytelling is nuanced, with each character's journey feeling both intimate and monumental in the grand scheme of the Dune universe. Timothée Chalamet's return as Paul Atreides is nothing short of mesmerizing. His portrayal of Paul's evolution from a boy burdened by prophecy to a leader embroiled in desert warfare is executed with a depth and vulnerability that's rarely seen in science fiction epics.The newcomers to the cast bring fresh dynamics that enhance the story in unexpected ways, blending seamlessly with the returning ensemble to create a rich tapestry of characters.

But unfortunately, the only thing that improved here was the visuals and the action, and they were fine even in the first movie too.I rewatched the first Dune again before watching this because I didn't remember much from the first time I watched it 3 years ago. And I think I understood the story of the first movie better this time, but my overall enjoyment of the first movie and feelings about it were the exact same; it's a decent introduction to this universe and characters, but lacks the needed emotional connection of the viewer with the characters, and the characterization needs a lot of work. (And obviously, the story suddenly ending)\n",
            "When I reviewed the first movie, I said hopefully a second movie would be made to complete the story and give a better characterization to these characters. But sadly, this movie continued with the same shallow characterization problem as the first film.These movies aren't short either, they are nearly 3 hours, so they have all the time in the world to make you care about these characters and flesh them out. But most of the time is spent on \"cool\" visuals and action scenes. And don't get me wrong, the visuals are amazing, absolutely 10/10 visuals and cinematography. But the storytelling and characterization here is 6/10 or 7/10 at best. So how can a movie be a \"masterpiece\" if only the visuals are good but the story is lacking?Many people compare these movies to The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and that actually highlights the problems of this movie and also reinforces what a miracle it was that the LOTR trilogy turned out the way it was and no one has been able to reproduce the magic of those movies, not even Peter Jackson himself.Comparing Dune to LOTR, you'll realize how much thought and work had gone into making LOTR and its characters relatable, easily making the audience familiar with these characters, and allowing them to form a great emotional connection to them. LOTR was written as an adaptation that the book-readers can enjoy, and the audience who hadn't read the books could also watch and still get the story and understand the characters and their motivations. You don't need to read the books to understand every character in the movie and why they did what they did, or having to read to make an emotional connection to them. The films already did those things masterfully.But Dune? It definitely is a movie that's made for people who are already familiar with the universe and have already read the books. It's like a summary with cool action montages of the important plot points that leaves out the character-building and much-needed parts to make the audience understand the character arc of Paul Atreides.Attack on Titan did that with Eren Yeager and you could understand the transformation of this protagonist throughout the story. But in this movie, Paul just changes suddenly toward the end of the movie and the movie does a poor job of justifying that. Instead of giving more time to flesh out this plot point and show what happened and show a gradual change in Paul, we are mostly shown cool visual effects and unimportant scenes with the villains that do nothing to help these antagonists become more than cartoonishly evil one-dimensional characters.And I understand that Attack on Titan is a long anime/manga and definitely had a lot more time to make you care about its characters compared to two movies that are only over 2 hours. And I also understand that Dune is apparently a really difficult book to adapt to a visual medium, and that it's a miracle these two movies even turned out as decent as they did. But like I said, LOTR already proved that you can have the cool visuals, but also have the depth, good storytelling, and great characterization in your movie too.Denis Villeneuve has said that he made Dune for himself, fulfilling his childhood wish. And as nice of a sentiment that sounds, that is the problem with Dune. It's made for himself and those who already know this story. It's not made for someone who wants to get to know this world and characters for the first time via the movies.And like I said, it's not only the protagonists that suffer from a lack of good characterization so the audience can have an emotional connection to them. The villains even lack more. The introduction of Feyd-Rautha and the gladiator arena scene are definitely some of the most unique and iconic scenes in any movie I've ever seen. It shows you that \"yeah, this guy doesn't eff around and is different\" very well. But what happens after that? He just becomes another \"bad guy who eats an apple with a knife and randomly kills his own henchmen because they said hello to him\". Not to mention they don't show what he does differently than Rabban that makes him better and more dangerous. The only thing he does is shoot missiles at the Fremen, and Baron calls it \"genius\"? Really? If it was so easy, why couldn't Rabban do it before? Not to mention how disappointing Baron's character is too. You'd think he's an intimidating and powerful villain when watching the first movie, but you're gonna be unpleasantly disappointed by him in this one.And it is sad because Villeneuve actually knows how to write good \"human\" characters and make the audience have an emotional connection with them. He's not Nolan. He's already shown he knows how to write good characters the audience can relate to with Incendies, Arrival, Prisoners, and many more. So I don't know if it was a deliberate choice or he was restricted from making the movie longer and had to cut a lot of scenes that fleshed out these characters more.So I talked a lot about the negatives and I don't want to repeat myself and only talk about the problems I had with it. I still give the movie a 7 because the visuals and the music are too good to give it lower, but I could even give it a 6 because of the story.So 7/10 is still not bad, but considering the rating and the raving, I expected more.Like I said, the cinematography, the direction for the most part, the music, and the action are all 10/10 here and it's a quality blockbuster that more blockbusters should try to follow, but not the storytelling part though.The movie is enjoyable and I didn't really find it boring, though some scenes could've been cut out or dedicated to better flesh out the story and characters. But it's a decent continuation of the first film.When the movie came out and received all the great reviews and ratings, I kept seeing some people saying they liked the first Dune better and I was really confused about how they could like the first movie more if everyone was saying this one is a masterpiece and better in every way. But after finally watching it myself, I can honestly say that I enjoyed the first Dune more too, and I can't believe I liked this one less. Don't get me wrong, the first Dune also greatly suffers from characterization and better storytelling, but it was still a more coherent story than this film's.Overall, it's not a bad movie, but massively disappointed me, especially after seeing the great ratings and reviews it received. It's a movie that's mainly made for the people who've already read the books and know these characters, and they can enjoy these movies more than your average movie-watcher who isn't familiar with this story and characters. I have the same emotional connection to these characters as I did before knowing them for the first time. 10/10 visuals and action, 6/10 storytelling and characterization.\n",

The first part of Dune seemed to me a cheap caricature full of classic Hollywood ingredients to get money out of the masses.I didn't want to watch this movie, especially after the trailer that seemed to me like another parody (my mistake, someone needs to be fired), but I said \"I'd give it a chance\", and the movie far exceeded my humble expectations!!The first film explained nothing and said nothing, but this one makes everything clear. If at the beginning of the first part we only had famous actors who were put in front of camera just to say two or three sentences only to leave the frame moment's after and never return, now we have the joy of seeing how the characters develop and come to life in this space sci-fi world.As far as actors are concerned, I never liked Timothee Chalament (He's not a bad actor, I just don't like how he act), because he always seems like a little girl who ran out of buffers, but in this movie he does a monumental work with his character.I could say that he gave life to \"Paul Atreides\" and became what any good actor should become, his own character. (Frank Herbert would have been proud, i think...).I liked the direction where character went, I saw a little darkness in his eyes after the second half of the movie, which reminds me of Anakin SkyWalker for a moment, I'm curious where he will go with this thing... Maybe something evil is coming, that would put pressure on him, but it would bring him a lot of success if he plays it well.As for the secondary characters, Rebecca Ferguson as \"Princess Jessica\" does a good job, you can finally say that she is acting and it's scares you how good she is.Javier Bardem as \"Stilgar\" is the soul of this film, although there are some scenes and moments when he seems to be forced to say or do something... thing that takes him out of character... But hey.... the 12-year-old kid's who watche the movie, must laugh too.Josh Brolin returns as \"Gurney Halleck\" and does it in style, offers an extra dose of energy and has a part in the story, it's not just a decoration.Stellan Skarsgard as \"Baron Vladimir\" does an insane job, just like in the first part.Zendaya plays \"Chani\" well, she has good lines and a pleasant interpretation.And the last, but not the forgetten, \"Austin Butler\" who kills it into the role of \"Feyd-Rautha\" (I wished to see more of him), but as much as he was, he brought his contribution to the film.The rest of the casting made a small but vital contribution. Every person involved in this project deserves praise and appreciation, they made everything possible.Regarding the technique, the film is shot in color, and in black and white, depending on the environment, which I liked, the frames are interesting and full of light.The fight scenes are well done, although in some cases they could be extended or at least worked on a bit more.The director of the film,\n",

I hope we remember this future trilogy as an example of how art is made and offer it as a lesson for the following films and movie maker's.I'll only give it 9 stars, because, as I said before, some fight scenes and some details could be worked on, the dialogue has a few slips sometimes and it take the light away, but overall it's more than perfect.

The forced love story between Paul and Chani, however, veered too far away from the book in an attempt to create a tragic romance for the sake of a Hollywood ending, and ultimately ruined the movie.Spoilers. For those who haven't read the book, the romance between Paul and Chani (sounding like 'Johnny' when Timothée Chalamet says it), is not a source of tension. The falsely created subplot, in which Chani declares Paul a false prophet, and the overall sour-faced, disgruntled demeanor that Zendaya portrays during the last quarter of the movie, are fabrications by Denis Villeneuve. The bigger question is, does this enhance or take away from the overall story? Absolutely, without a doubt, this detracts from the story because it shifts focus from the central nemesis of the film while simultaneously failing in an attempt to create a love story that the audience cares about.To cap it off, the final close-up on Chani emitting a pouty, quivering chin is a failed attempt to evoke heartbreak we should care about.Denis was trying way too hard to create the Trinity/Neo romance and somehow force it into his version of Dune, which up until this point did a superb job of sticking to the pages of the book. Dune part one: excellent. Dune part two: ruined by a flat, forced, zero-chemistry, poorly executed, made-for-the-movie heartbreak story. Or perhaps it's simply a poor performance by Zendaya, who came across as far too unlikable. I've talked to others who didn't read the book and felt the same way. Either way, it's a miss.\n",

The intricate plot of Herbert's masterpiece is treated with a careless disregard, resulting in a rushed and disjointed narrative. Instead of delving into the depth and complexity of the source material, the film meanders through superfluous scenes that add little to the overarching story.Where the1984 Dune adaptation succeeded was in its faithful and nuanced storytelling. Each scene served a purpose, advancing the plot and deepening our understanding of the characters and their motivations. The pacing was deliberate, allowing viewers to immerse themselves fully in the rich tapestry of Herbert's universe.In contrast, \"Dune Part Two\" feels like a series of missed opportunities. Important plot points are glossed over or omitted entirely, leaving viewers bewildered and unsatisfied. Characters lack depth and development, reducing them to mere caricatures of their literary counterparts.While the visuals are undoubtedly stunning and the performances commendable, they cannot compensate for the film's fundamental narrative shortcomings. \"Dune Part Two\" is a prime example of style over substance, a hollow shell of what could have been a truly remarkable cinematic experience.In conclusion, \"Dune Part Two\" fails spectacularly in capturing the essence of Herbert's masterpiece.

Added to this is Villeneuve and Zimmer's personal dedication to the original book and their close collaboration with Herbert's descendants. What's really brilliant is that the film succeeds in explaining the very complex history of the universe, which even in the books cannot be understood without a glossary, in such a way that the inexperienced viewer understands the plot coherently and the experienced viewer recognises the subtle allusions. The usual challenges of science fiction films are solved well, some questions are simply not allowed to be asked, as is typical of the genre (such as how to descend from Shai-Hulud - analogous to: Why didn't the eagles fly to Mordor?). Anyone who is petty here does not understand the metaphor of fantasy.From the very first minute, you are captivated by this galaxy created by Herbert, which Villeneuve and Fraser (and many others) design with visual magnificence, supported by the inimitable acoustic support from Zimmer. The entire film crew pushed themselves to their limits, and sometimes you only recognise the masterly craftsmanship at second glance (my third cinema is at doorstep, still counting). Just to mention the infrared scene on Giedi Prime, the novel and different sounds of the various planets, the voice of Loire Cotler, the performance of the (real) actors in the (real) desert, the clever use of mass psychological rhetoric and the entire costume and set design.The film is a holistic work of art whose atmosphere and pathos simply overwhelm me and either leave me speechless or elicit minutes of praise.

Had I not read the book several times I would have felt completely lost watching both films in the theater. I thought the pacing and action made this sequel a bit more exciting for anyone who had never read the book but I had to see it twice because I spent much of my first viewing explaining missing elements that tied the overall plot together so that it made sense to them.The visuals and cinematography are grand in scale and mind blowing, though and make the 1980's movie look as low budget as a modern indie film and the soundtrack and was so amazing it was like it was as much of a character as the actors themselves. Though initially taken aback by some of the MAJOR plot changes they did lessen my enjoyment of the movie.SPOILERS:Problems I had as such a HUGE fan of the book:1.) The Harkonnens never seemed quite menacing enough or as much of a threat as they were in the book and their defeat seemed much too easy. They came across more as menacing bafoons.2.) It was never explained just how important Spice was and why: it was the only way to travel instantly cross the universe and the Harkonnens were so wealthy and powerful because of it.3.) The importance of the relationship between Timothy Chalomet and his Mother as well as his relationship to Zendaya fell short of how important they were in the book.4.) The different religious themes of the book were greatly undermined to make the movie almost entirely political but since religion is being phased out of our secular world why not phase it out of fictional books, right?5.) Timothy Chalomet's performance and transformation from the beginning of the first film to the end of the second was impressive to watch which is a testament to his artistry as an actor but the film left out a lot of the training and studying of both his physical skills and knowledge made that transition seem much easier for him in both films than they were in the book but I understand time constraints.Many of these issues have been addressed in other reviews so I won't go on...The beauty and music of this movie were a masterpiece of cinematography, lighting, sound and an awe inspiring soundtrack.

During my previous watch, I looked at the movie as more like the good versus the evil, but now my only focus is on Paul. Everything is about him himself. He is the one who moves the people. He is the one who makes a change for the world. My focus was too much on the antagonists during my first-time watch because I was disappointed with how easily they were defeated after a huge build-up, but now I see that part as a strengthening element to the depiction of Paul as Lisan al Gaib. The weaknesses of the antagonists make Paul so much more powerful, and I love it!In terms of the technical aspects, they are probably the best ones I have ever experienced. They are not perfect, but you cannot get much better quality in 2024. Dune: Part Two has everything; cinematography, sound, score, CGI, practical effects, locations, costumes, makeup, props.

Writing, visuals, sound design/music, and acting at its absolute highest levels on the grandest scale. Truly epic. One of the best adaptations from novel to screen ever made. No easy task either given the film's source material, but executed tastefully and dare I say, flawlessly utilizing minor alterations to create the best film it can be. Believe the hype. If you don't like this movie, then well, I guess epic sci-fi stories and deserts simply aren't your thing. Fair enough, but for most of us, it really doesn't get any better than this.The script is excellent. This was a very hard novel to adapt, and the writers have truly done a fantastic job with it.

Overall, each change, cut, or addition makes for a better movie, still remaining faithful to the films source material. I will admit however, that the Dune nerd in me would have liked to see that talking baby... but the way they did it was effective and probably better for the silver screen. Frank Herbert purist might get pretty bummed over this, but not I. The change works well, and I trust Denis Villeneuve with what he wanted to do in his telling.I want to point out that I was kind of surprised how terrific the acting in this film was considering the amount of vanity and celebrity the cast seems to bask in. This isn't just a cast of what Marilyn Manson would call \"the beautiful people\" but actually a talented one. Timothy Chalamet really brings it in the films second half.

His character is beautifully written in this screenplay, providing smart laugh out loud comic relief but also delivering serious dramatic scenes with awesome dialogue. His delivery of \"I don't care if you do not believe, I believe...\" which was perfectly placed in the trailer is even better in the film.

The climatic final knife fight was the best I had scene since the climatic sword fight in Rob Roy. But I can't write this gushing review without mentioning the sand-worm riding scene where Paul first mounts one of these iconic beast. WOW. This goes down as one of my favorite scenes ever in a film. I practically edged myself off my seat, even knowing what the outcome would be having read the book. It was just... wow, so cool.Upon the movie ending, my wife and I just wanted to stay in the theater and watch it over again. I can't wait to see this film again, and again, and again.

I hope you all feel the same as I did, because both Dune and Dune: Part 2 are some of the greatest times I've had at the movies in the past twenty years. This is what large budget major studio films should be. This is art on its grandest scale, not just a cheap attempt to cash in on a beloved franchise. It's so refreshing and nice to see that Hollywood still has a few quality films to make. In my personal opinion, Timothy Chalamet and Zendaya earned every right to wear those ludicrous outfits on the red carpet.

Paul Muad'dib is sadly taking his own Anakin-like route down this fictional universe.What Dune established is further cemented and cemented very well by Dune 2, Denis Villeneuve has delivered a groundbreaking addition into the Science-fiction genre and it is one that in comparison to its sluggish predecessor, is one to remember. There are emotions here and such a connection to this universe that is crafted that cannot be said to not be genuinely making you want to see more.As we follow the story of the Fremen and Paul Atreides' (Timothee Chalamet) fulfilment of his true legacy, we start to wrestle with the dangerous idea of faith and despair - for the struggles of the Fremen can only be ended by the arrival of the Lisan Al Gaib - this being a sacrificial path to take. The world building Denis Villeneuve puts into play is to me\n",
            "like none other that we've seen for a long time, of course Dune 1 is equally as amazing yet what Dune 2 manages to add on is just unbelievable.Regarding the casting, there are some soon-to-come Oscar's whose rightful owners should belong to the cast of Dune 2. Timothee Chalamet for one has undoubtedly proven himself in recent years as one of this generations acting powerhouse - from his flamboyant portrayal of Willy Wonka to his role as the deeply confused teenager Elio in Call Me By Your Name. His portrayal of Paul Atreides in this installment of the Dune universe is gripping and impactful, we are seeing a \"troubled villain\" in the making and his portrayal of the religiously haunted saint of the Fremen is incredible, as he balances saving those he cares about with discovering who he truly is. As for Chani (played by the talented Zendaya) there is not much to say due to sheer awe. Zendaya is an emotional lead and a powerhouse at the front of the Fremen, she embodies the struggles of the people of the dunes battling the corruption of religious fanaticism. I was also very charmed and taken off guard by the sheer excellence of Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha, the new governor of Arrakis. To say he may be the best villain since Heath Ledger's much respected Joker would not be undeserving praise. However, Feyd-Rautha sadly suffers from the issue that comes with killing a villain off too quickly, being that his true potential is not fully witnessed. It was also very nice to see the lovely Javier Bardem play both a religiously devoted fanatic and Timothee Chalamet's biggest hypeman, though I do wish Dennis Villeneuve had explored more the gripping conflict plaguing his mind - due to Stilgar being a plagued man in the books, struggling with his devotion to this prophecy. As for the rest of the supporting cast - whose roles though at times did not take the spotlight as much - don't leave much to be said except for sheer appreciation for such a passionate portrayal. Rebecca Ferguson stepping into the reverend mother identity of Lady Jessica and giving up a lot of the things she cared for is such a sad portrayal of a mothers sometimes sacrificial role. Equally, Josh Brolin (Avengers Endgame, No Country For Old Men) and his portrayal of Gurney is better than ever with his character truly being such a good shoulder to lean on for our young Atreides. The whole cast is deserving of so many applauds for their chemistry and ability to connect to bring this universe alive, never felt more connected to a cast and their characters who I have now\n",

With his green eyes, androgynous face and smooth curly hair, he is so photogenic all the time, that if you were to pause this movie at certain moments, you could swear the still is from one of those fancy fashion commercials he's recently been in under the direction of Martin Scorsese. And Denis Villeneuve knows this.So much so, in fact, that he's decided to hype us up even more in \"Part Two\", again taking his time, making sure the light on Chalamet's should-be insured face falls at the perfect angle and each grain of sand is venerated akin to \"Lawrence of Arabia\"--the timeless masterpiece epic that Villeneuve also adores. So yeah, the teasing here has intensified; but so did the good things: the anti-elitist themes found in Frank Herbert's novel now go deeper into themes of faith, religion and manipulation; the scope is grander; the cinematography? Jaw-dropping! Especially the black and white homeworld of the Harkonnen, Giedi Prime, on which Austin Butler's villainous Feyd-Rautha steals the show in terms of performance as he spills black blood on white skin. And for the first time in Villeneuve's career, there are genuinely funny moments too.Overall, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a better movie than its predecessor. And it's quite a feat to be so without changing or eliminating the flaws of the first movie. Instead, Villeneuve proves that he is fully committed to thoroughly dissecting Herbert's novel to its full power. And it pays off. Even if there is no catharsis in \"Part Two\", the hype train we are being taken over is dense and brutal. Without going into the chunky plot, just know that by the end we are left with one of the greatest cliffhangers in cinema history in which good and evil alternates between characters and the stage is fully set for what's to come.Is a dangerous game director/writer Denis Villeneuve is playing by making so many promises.

            "Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two isn't just a sequel; it's a cinematic culmination, a harmonious fusion of awe-inspiring visuals, profound storytelling, and pulse-pounding action. This film transcends the limitations of mere science fiction, establishing itself as a grand operatic experience that will leave audiences breathless.Having laid the groundwork in the first part, Villeneuve dives headfirst into the heart of Frank Herbert's legendary saga. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is no longer the wide-eyed Duke's son. Haunted by visions and burdened by his messianic destiny, he walks a tightrope between prophecy and peril. Chalamet delivers a powerful performance, capturing Paul's inner turmoil and burgeoning leadership with remarkable nuance.The supporting cast shines even brighter. Zendaya's Chani emerges as a formidable warrior and Paul's emotional anchor. Rebecca Ferguson masterfully portrays Lady Jessica, a mother caught between love for her son and the machinations of the Bene Gesserit. Javier Bardem brings a gravitas and charisma to Stilgar, the leader of the Fremen, that resonates deeply. Each character is meticulously crafted, their motivations and complexities woven into the narrative tapestry.Visually, Dune: Part Two is a feast for the eyes. The filmmakers have conjured a breathtaking vision of Arrakis, a desert planet teeming with danger and wonder. The sandworms are even more awe-inspiring, their gargantuan forms slithering across the dunes in sequences that redefine cinematic scale. The costume and production design are equally impressive, transporting viewers to a world both familiar and alien.The action sequences are masterfully choreographed and executed. The film doesn't shy away from depicting the brutality of combat, but the violence serves a purpose, highlighting the stakes of Paul's struggle. The use of sound design further elevates these scenes, with the thunderous roar of the sandworms and the whine of lasguns creating a truly immersive experience.But Dune: Part Two is more than just spectacle. Villeneuve delves deeper into Herbert's themes of ecology, colonialism, and religious fanaticism. The film explores the consequences of unchecked ambition and the dangers of succumbing to messianic fervor. Paul's journey is not a clear-cut path to heroism; it's a harrowing exploration of power and its corrupting influence.The score by Hans Zimmer deserves special mention. It's a powerful and evocative soundscape that perfectly complements the film's visuals and emotional core. The music throbs with a primal energy, mirroring the harsh beauty of Arrakis and the inner struggles of its characters.Dune: Part Two is a rare cinematic achievement. It's a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll, prompting reflection and discussion. It's a testament to the power of storytelling, a visually stunning epic that resonates on a deeply human level. This is not just a must-see for fans of the first film; it's a must-see for anyone who appreciates grand, thought-provoking cinema. In a world saturated with sequels and franchises, Dune: Part Two stands out as a masterpiece, a film that fully deserves its perfect 10/10 rating.\n",
            "Document 318 (Score: 0.0169): There's been a lot of hyperbole and superlatives about this movie since it released. While it is a solid, entertaining sci fi movie, labeling it the GOAT or anything similar to that, is just people fanning out over it. Maybe it's just the time that we're living in now, where people are prisoners of the moment far too often but I remember a time when it took something way more groundbreaking than what this movie offers to call it the greatest sci fi movie of all time. There's really nothing \"special\" about it. Sure, the cinematography is strong and some of the action scenes are very entertaining but there's nothing crazy innovative about this film. It's a sort of paint by the numbers - messiah type tale. The chemistry between zendaya and chalamet is really good and Butler turns in a solid turn as the villain. But outside of that, there's nothing that's gonna etch this movie in the sands of time, imo. I remember when The Matrix came out and seeing that in theaters and being completely mind blown by it!!! I had never seen anything like that before. It may be unfair but that'll be a standard I'll hold any movie vying for \"best sci fi film of all time\" to until my last days as a film watcher. This is a solid movie but don't buy into the hype, temper your expectations and you'll enjoy it just fine.Definitely a film that is more enjoyable on a large screen with great surround sound. The director and his crew set up some really great looking shots that are best enjoyed on a large screen. With that said, the score and visual aesthetic is very one note and drab. Which, I get it, it's part of the mood and tone the director is going for. But for me it's very sterile and cold. Not an insane fun, hold on to the seat of your pants type film with a ROUSING score that gets you hyped for the action that's unfolding before you. Having seen Dune Part One recently, it's not that I necessarily expected that from this movie but when I heard the \"goat\" word being thrown around, it did raise my expectations of what we'd see on the screen.Again, a fine film but nothing genre defining imo. One of those that you can watch once and you'll be fine with lol.Unlike the best of this genre where you can't wait to rewatch it over and over and over again...! Where the action is unlike anything you've ever seen, the characters are rich and layered, and likable figures. The score is fun and captivating even if it's a dark one. You go and tell everyone that they need to watch this movie ASAP. In my book, that's the TRUE definition of any films that look to call themselves the greatest sci fi film of all time.\n",
            "Document 3 (Score: 0.0168): I'm going to write this as a review for both Dune movies, so I'll include my thoughts about Dune part one throughout. For me, the most difficult part about rating these movies is trying to judge them as they stand on their own without comparing them to the original book.As movies, I think both are great: the cinematography is amazing, the sound design is good, the acting is good, I liked the visual style and how they interpreted the various technologies of the world of Dune. The soundtrack is good, it can be a little overbearing at times but the music in part two felt like an improvement on this from part one. One of the biggest complaints people had with both movies is the pacing, saying that the first movie was dragging and the second was rushing. I agree with the sentiments about the latter, but personally I enjoyed the slower pacing of the first Dune movie. The second movie definitely moves quickly through its first half, then it slows down a lot in the second half before rushing to its conclusion.The casting is good for the most part, I personally disagree with casting Rebecca Ferguson but I'll get into that more later. In the first movie I wasn't especially impressed with Timothée Chalamet as Paul but I think he does better in the role in the second part. Jason Momoa was a perfect pick for Duncan Idaho and Oscar Isaac did a great job as Duke Leto. Stellan Skarsgard was a good choice for Baron Harkonnen but I think he could have been written better. I was really looking forward to seeing Christopher Walken as the Emperor Shaddam but unfortunately he felt pretty lifeless and didn't bring very much energy to the scenes he was in.Overall, as they stand on their own, the Dune movies are great films. I don't know if I'd call them the defining sci-fi movies of the 21st century like other people are saying, but they're still very good, definitely rewatchable, and I would recommend them.Now, moving on to comparing them to the books, because once you start doing that you get to the more disappointing side of these movies. One of the biggest issues with both movies, especially the second, is that they almost completely leave out the ecological message of the book. This is a book that has been used as a textbook in environmental science classes, but I guess the filmmakers decided that message wasn't important enough. The Fremen are shown to be working towards terraforming Dune into a green world, slowly but surely making wind traps and planting grasses to fix the dunes in place. It's a goal that they are working towards with total commitment even though they know that it won't be realized for several generations. That's a powerful message that I think a lot more people need to hear nowadays, especially in reference to the issue of climate change. The movie barely mentions this goal at all, which I think is a disservice to the original story, and it diminishes the Fremen as characters.I think the fundamental issue that these movies have with their adaptations is an understandable one, but that it could've been solved in a better way. The main issue with adapting the book is that the characters are very difficult to relate to: most of them are superhumans who have insane abilities. For the movies, a lot of the main characters are altered to make them more relatable to the audience, which is an understandable change. For some characters, this greatly improves them from the book, such as Duncan Idaho and Duke Leto. For others, like Chani and Jessica, it reduces the strength of their characters, which I'll explain more later.Additionally, the book has a lot of complex concepts and story plots that it never stops to fully explain to the reader, you're just supposed to pick it up as you go along and reread it to understand, making it a little obtuse. Dune is very dialogue-heavy, with a lot of the action happening in the background or only described briefly. To remedy this, the movies remove some of the more complex topics and add more action scenes, which are exciting and well choreographed, but in the second movie they start feeling repetitive and redundant, and they overpower the more intricate plot points.While the first movie cleverly managed to insert a lot of exposition without feeling like it was constantly lore dumping, part two feels like it's more afraid to explain things than the first, possibly because of complaints that \"nothing happened\" in the first movie. The result of this is that the second movie is much more action-heavy, but it still wants to include the complex topics from the book, so what we get is a bunch of action sequences with scenes of political complexities strung in between them, but without the full explanations necessary to clarify them. It's easy to understand why people who haven't read the books would feel confused by this, the movie barely takes the time to explain what's happening before it's moving on to the next scene of Fremen blowing up spice haulers.Getting into direct comparisons to the book now, and starting with the first movie: my two biggest issues with the first movie was how they changed Jessica and how they dumbed down the mentats. Starting with mentats, they are a hugely important part of all of the Dune books; Thufir Hawat is essentially a main character in the first book, and Peter de Vries is a terrifying mastermind behind the Harkonnen plans. Part of what triggers Paul's first vision of the coming Jihad in his name is that his mother tells him he was trained as a mentat from birth without his knowledge. In the movie, the word mentat is never said once; Paul's mentat training isn't brought up; Thufir Hawat is just a guy who rolls his eyes back in his head, says something smart and then disappears at the halfway mark; and Peter de Vries dies of poisoning. How disappointing.But what I think is the worse change that they made from the book is how they changed Jessica's character. While the Dune books get much more feminist as they go on, the first book has very few female characters. However, Jessica makes for a very strong main character: she has complete control over her mind and body, and through her Bene Gesserit training she has almost superhuman strength, speed, and can control others with the Voice. Her internal monologue also shows that she's almost always two steps ahead of everyone except Paul. In the movies, Jessica feels much weaker. In the first movie she's almost always crying or on the verge of tears, which makes it a lot believable when she starts killing Harkonnens with her bear hands, and it makes the scene in the tent when Paul gets his vision (the only part of the book where Jessica openly grieves) much less powerful.Moving on to the second movie is where the changes get more disappointing. The movie begins with Paul, Jessica and the Fremen fighting the Harkonnens in some battle between the fight with Jamis and them getting to Sietch Tabr, which wasn't in the book and felt like it was added for the sake of starting with an action sequence. After the fight, Jessica throws up involuntarily --- again, as a Bene Gesserit she should have total control over her body and it doesn't make sense for her to do that, even though she's pregnant.Speaking of Jessica's child, Alia isn't really a character in this, at least not like she was in the book. I can understand this, I had no idea how they were going to handle having a toddler who walks and talks like an adult and kills a man, and they handled it by having Jessica not give birth during the movie. They also don't really explain how Alia is pre-born, which is a piece of information that people who didn't read the book could probably use.Once Paul and Jessica get to Sietch Tabr, things feel a lot different. The book describes the interiors of the Sietch as being covered with drapery, rugs, and cushions. There are classrooms, plastic factories, and workshops. The movie doesn't show this at all: the Sietch interior is all smooth, carved stone rather than natural rock walls, there's no textiles to be seen, and essentially only the water reservoir is shown. In general, the depiction of the Fremen in the movie is much worse than the book. The Fremen are a very tight-knit community where people understand each other's needs so well that they don't even need to communicate them out loud. When Jessica feels like she needs a coffee, a Fremen with coffee simply appears without her giving an order. In the movie the Fremen are three things: good at stabbing people, fanatic believers in Paul, or people who hate the Mahdi prophecy and don't believe in Paul. In the book, this dissenting faction against Paul isn't really present, and Chani definitely isn't part of it. I can understand that the filmmakers probably added it to help drive home the anti-hero worship message which a lot of people missed from the book, but it could have been executed better.I also disliked how they changed Chani. In the books she very easily falls for Paul and gives him unwavering support, and I think it's fine that they wanted to make that more nuanced for the movies, but I don't like the way they did it. The movie wants us to think that they love each other even though it constantly shows Chani ranting against the prophecy and disagreeing with Paul's actions. In the end, she leaves Paul after he agrees to marry the Emperor's daughter Irulan (even though in the book he makes it clear that he is only marrying her for politics, refuses to even touch her, and has three children with Chani instead). This ending will definitely complicate things if they do go through with adapting Dune Messiah to complete the film trilogy.I'm running out of room to write, and most people probably won't read this anyway because of the length, so I'll just say again that I enjoyed the movies and think they're good, but some of the changes they made, especially in part two, were disappointing and could have been executed better.\n",

The black and white scenes, reminiscent of archival footage from fascist Germany, are particularly striking and add a unique aesthetic to the storytelling.However, the overall pacing and editing of the film leave something to be desired. The narrative flow is often disrupted by abrupt cuts and seemingly unconnected scenes. It appears that an abundance of material was shot, and the process of trimming it down to a manageable length may have been a challenging one. Despite these efforts, the film still clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours and 46 minutes.The plot of Dune Part 2 bears some resemblance to the TV series Game of Thrones, with its complex political machinations, warring factions, and power struggles. However, the film's storytelling falls short in comparison to the depth and intricacy of the HBO series. The limited runtime of a theatrical release may have constrained the filmmakers' ability to fully explore the richness of the source material. Perhaps a television adaptation would have been a more suitable format to delve into the nuances of the Dune universe and its characters.In terms of performances, Austin Butler's portrayal of Feyd-Rautha is a standout. Butler brings a magnetic presence and charisma to the role, overshadowing even the lead actor, Timothée Chalamet, who plays Paul Atreides. Chalamet struggles to match the intensity and allure of Butler's Feyd-Rautha, and his performance is merely a shadow in comparison.Overall, Dune Part 2 is a film that aspires to greatness but falls short in its execution.

As the second installment in Villeneuve's adaptation of Frank Herbert's epic science fiction saga, \"Dune 2\" surpasses its predecessor in every aspect, solidifying its status as a cinematic masterpiece deserving of a perfect 10/10 rating.One of the most striking elements of \"Dune 2\" is its visual prowess. From the barren landscapes of Arrakis to the intricately designed technology of the futuristic universe, every frame is meticulously crafted to immerse the audience in the rich tapestry of Herbert's universe. Cinematographer Greig Fraser masterfully captures the grandeur of the desert planet, using sweeping shots and dynamic camera movements to evoke a sense of scale and awe. The visual effects, seamlessly integrated into the narrative, enhance the film's otherworldly atmosphere, transporting viewers to a universe where the impossible becomes tangible.However, \"Dune 2\" is not merely a feast for the eyes; it is also a triumph of storytelling. Villeneuve and screenwriter Jon Spaihts skillfully navigate the complex narrative of Herbert's novel, distilling its intricate plot and multifaceted characters into a coherent and engrossing cinematic experience. The film's pacing is expertly calibrated, allowing the story to unfold organically while maintaining a sense of urgency and tension. Each scene is imbued with meaning, contributing to the overarching themes of power, destiny, and the human condition.Central to the film's success are the performances of its ensemble cast. Timothée Chalamet delivers a tour de force performance as Paul Atreides, the reluctant hero burdened with the weight of prophecy. Chalamet brings depth and vulnerability to the role, embodying Paul's internal struggle with grace and nuance. Opposite him, Rebecca Ferguson shines as Lady Jessica, Paul's mother torn between duty and love. Ferguson infuses her character with strength and complexity, elevating her beyond the typical female archetype often found in science fiction.The supporting cast is equally impressive, with each actor bringing their A-game to the table. Oscar Isaac commands the screen as Duke Leto Atreides, projecting authority and compassion in equal measure. Zendaya captivates as Chani, the mysterious Fremen warrior caught in the midst of a brewing conflict. Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem round out the ensemble, delivering memorable performances that add depth and dimension to the film's ensemble.Beyond its technical and narrative achievements, \"Dune 2\" is a triumph of thematic depth and philosophical inquiry. At its core, the film grapples with timeless questions about power, identity, and the nature of humanity. Through Paul's journey, we are forced to confront the consequences of our actions and the moral complexities of leadership. Villeneuve deftly explores these themes, challenging the audience to reflect on their own beliefs and values.In addition to its thematic richness, \"Dune 2\" is a masterclass in world-building. Villeneuve and his creative team have painstakingly brought Herbert's universe to life, from the intricacies of its political landscape to the nuances of its cultural traditions.

The result is a fully realized and immersive cinematic experience that transports viewers to a distant future unlike anything they've ever seen before.In conclusion, \"Dune 2\" is nothing short of a cinematic triumph. With its breathtaking visuals, compelling storytelling, and powerhouse performances, it surpasses its predecessor and cements itself as a modern classic. Denis Villeneuve has created a masterpiece that not only honors Frank Herbert's seminal work but also pushes the boundaries of what science fiction cinema can achieve. \"Dune 2\" is not just a film; it's an experience-one that deserves to be celebrated and remembered for years to come.\n",

The lack of dialogue didn't work for me, although it's an aspect that would lessen the more I learned about the characters and world. I just don't get much of a chance at that within the movie. Despite my uninvolvement of the Dune world and its characters, I still have to be honest with the faults of the script and editing.Other than the overarching plot, scenes happen rather than you being lead into scenes via an emotional journey. The first hour is a back and forth of random tests and does she like him or not. Many characters simply appear in the movie, some deep into the runtime, including a main villain who has no discernible traits other than evil for the sake of it. Some characters appear very briefly and don't do much at all. The motivation of everyone was stripped out of the script. We see an abundant amount of screen time on someone riding a worm, but large battles will abrubtly end after very little setup. Did we need a large segment of screen time involving the nukes, when we could've just been told that there's nukes? The nuke scene feels as a standout filler sequence perhaps to be overshadow a few dozen moments of filler that could've been replaced with plot.I would challenge the praisers of this film to explain why everything was perfect. Austin Butler's character was great! Why? Because he was so one dimensional? The battles are the best! You mean snippets of battles that we got and one where it was hard to tell who was who. The score was amazing! Oh, the unbelievably overused bong noise that will randomly appear in the most tepid of scenes? Even the \"twist\" ending was foreshadowed in the first few minutes. This film is all spectacle with no emotional payoff. The number one praise that people will use to describe greatness of Dune 2 is the cinematography. This should be a leg that a great movie stands on, not the foundation. Although the direction and technicality of the look of Dune 2 is epic, the writing and editing are faulty. Maybe upon rewatches I would like it more since I might understand more of the details (after getting those details from other sources), but it's still nowhere as good as it could be or as most everyone seems to think it is.\n",

But first, the good bits: The audio is amazing and visually stunning. But that is it.The entire finale was inevitable. We are told it is inevitable from the beginning of the movie, so there is no suspense throughout the entire thing. It plays out exactly as expected: Paul is the chosen one. Some believe he is, and others don't. He is great at everything he does on the first try. Everyone is convinced to follow him anyway because he is great at everything. They attack the bad guys, the plan goes great, and Paul wins.We, as the audience, do not feel the same suspense and payoff as the characters. We know Paul is alive, so revealing him to other characters has no effect on us. Also, the other characters, like Princess Irulan and the Bene Gesserit, are just assuming he is alive anyway, so their actions are unaffected by his potential death.Gurney returns, and it is just an \"Ok. He's back. They hug. Now they have Gurney again.\" I am okay not knowing the whole backstory of how he survived, and I don't need to be spoonfed. But we get about a minute of Gurney doing his new thing until he bumps into Paul, and they hug it out. At least Gandalf's return in The Two Towers was fuelled by tension and foreshadowing, and the characters were there for a reason. For this, it was just \"whelp, another Fremen attack.\"Oh, and then Gurney casually mentions they have nukes, too, if they want them. Another thing handed to Paul on a silver platter. Which somehow is controversial for Chani. This brutal guerrilla fighter is suddenly like, \"Oh man, I was all for killing people, but this nuke situation... bad. Don't do it, Paul.\" but then that is it. No more discussion about this atomic arsenal. I don't even know if they used them in the final battle because the effect of the missiles they did use was not particularly atomic...So, while Paul is busy being great at everything but also Jon Snowing it by saying, \"But I don't want it.\" Rabban is having difficulty solving the Fremen problem, so we get introduced to Feyd-Rautha, apparently the Neville Longbottom of the Kwisatz Haderach prophecy. Who we get to see be more psychopathic than his brother and a prime candidate to solve the Fremen problem using his unique skillset of... doing the exact same thing his brother was doing, which is shelling the **** out of the desert. But this time, it just so happens that Feyd-Rautha shelled the correct place, Sietch Tabr. How did he know the right place? No idea. All we see as an audience is him doing the exact same thing his brother did. Great. Maybe show us that Feyd-Rautha is more competent instead of just telling us? Because licking knives and being a psychopath does not mean you are better at outthinking Fremen.So Paul goes south, which he did not want to do because he does not want to be Mr Prophecy Man, but now he has to. So when he gets there, he drinks the Water of Life that kills men but gives women memories of all their female ancestors, and he finds out he is half Harkonnen, which is... important? Why does he do this when he does not believe in the prophecy or want to be involved in it? Who knows. Maybe it is all a ruse. Maybe he does think he is the chosen one and has bluffed his way into being trusted. Sure, it is nice to finish a movie with something to think about, but the entire movie shouldn't be a complete tease with no payoff.Speaking of finishing the movie. The finale is. Paul and the Fremen bait out the emperor. They set a \"trap\" and the \"trap\" is... jump out of the sand and charge. Great. Really using the Fremen advantage here. The fight could have been so clever, but instead, it was an artillery strike, then a charge. Christ...So Paul walks into the throne room, kills Grandfather Baron Harkonnen, and challenges the emperor to single combat (which is just so tiresome to see these days). Feyd-Rautha volunteers to represent the emperor. So Paul and Feyd-Rautha try to knife each other. Feyd-Rautha stabs Paul! But wait! Paul wins! Because... he stabs Feyd-Rautha. So I guess Paul's stab was better than Feyd-Rautha's... Okay. So, the new bad guy with zero character development is dead.It wasn't a terrible movie. It was just unfulfilling. It was beautiful both visually and audibly. But the pacing was terrible; we had too much detail for meaningless sections and not enough for others. It is not a bad movie, but it is DEFINITELY not 10/10 material.Also, the Monty Python, Life of Brian reference... please...\n",

Plot-wise we've got warring intergalactic families fighting over the rights to the universe's most important mineral: 'Spice'. We have a good son with a mysterious mother, we've got evil villains (Harkonnens), and a rebel army (Fremen) with pet worms standing guard. Even so, better to lower your expectations. The giant worms ain't that much. The bald villains are too easy confused with one another. David Bautista is the one recognized villain, but he's weak in his role. The film is somber, morbid, heavy; not a light moment throughout its long running time.DUNE PART 2 is better. First, the plot is more compelling. The reasons for events in Part 1 are explained here. There is a love angle between the good son Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and a young Fremen woman Chani (Zendaya) which relieves the solemnity. In fact the very presence of Zendaya's character lifts the film mightily; she is without question someone to care about.Javier Bardem is great as the leader of The Fremen. Josh Brolin is rousing as Chalamet's protector. Austin Butler as the psychopathic next-in-line for the throne receives an A+ for creepiness (a compliment). Christopher Walken is wasted as the Emperor who is, no pun, wasting away. Why he was chosen for this role beats me. Florence Pugh as his daughter is simply 'there'. Her character is a sometimes narrator; the 'sometimes' element simply confusing. Overall there is an aura of self-importance about Dune 2, as though the viewer will take away an important lesson. But again, the heaviness, the weight of the characters' unhappiness, overpowers the 'good' that might be derived.In Part 2 many of these characters have secrets, as well as secret motives, though I, for one, was never quite sure about whose motives (with the exception of Chani's) were worth rooting for. The special effects here were disappointing; the worms were an improvement over Part 1, though seriously, I wanted to see more of them; ascertain how large they are, see them compared to other large structures. But no. I was never enthusiastic about the interstellar spacecraft; they appear more like a deck of playing cards than a speedy conveyance.Bottom line: Part 2 is a good film. However, I'd be perfectly fine if there were no Part 3.\n",

While some character arcs were told a bit quick, they did make sense in the end and lead to a more-than-epic climax and conclusion.

Not only is Dune Part 2 better than it's predecessor it is better than any Si-Fi movie in the last 10 years with the narrow and arguable exception to Interstellar. If this does not speak to the magnitude of Dune Part 2 then I don't know what does because for a Si-Fi action film this is as good as it gets almost perfect with nothing I would change as the viewer some ideas of this would be the actors the use of visual affects and CGI in certain areas of the film, and even the casting was unarguable.First of all, I would like to shed light on Austin Butler, because not only was he incredible and honestly a surprise; he was absolutely terrifying, this guy made any Star-Wars villain look like a stuffed animal, if only Dune part 2 came out a few months earlier because Austin Butler would have for sure been a front runner for best supporting actor because he was just breath taking and defiantly a star in a bright room.With Austin Butler being my stand out actor I still have to mention Timothee Chalamet because again he was unbelievable on the same level as Austin Butler contrary to my earlier comments, what makes me believe this is the passion and anger in his voice was just bone chilling and almost any scene where he was ready to make a decision sent shivers down my spine because all of the plot was falling into place but it was just amplified that much more with incredible acting.Now with my actors concluded I must talk about the CGI and visual affects because Dune Part 2 would be little without them. All I can say is WOW!!! The visual affects made Star-wars and Avatar look cheap and that is saying something considering it had nowhere near as much funding and budget I mean even the scenes with the sand worms where perfect and could not look any more realistic but I can't leave it there because it doesn't stop there, the space ship although other worldly still looked like they where one hundred percent real. Dune Part 2 really was a stunning spectacle for the eyes.And for the best part of Dune Part 2, the cinematography was some of the best you will ever see in your life and I mean it no movie of film ever comes remotely near especially in the Si-Fi genre which speaks to how incredible Dune Part 2 is. Even the black and white shots looked stunning and sharper than a knife no matter what you end up watching this on it will still look beautiful. One scene in particular that stood out which was when Timothee Chalamet and Austin Butler where fighting and the camara was set horizontally perpendicular to where they where fighting and the sun was symmetrical to the middle of the screen and the glare of the sun broke out into the audience, in short because I could talk about this one scene for hours , it was one of the greatest and most captivating scenes in any movie in history, truly amazing. There is so much more to cover with the cinematography but I don't have space or time but honestly you could watch Dune Part 2 just for the cinematography and you would be impressed.It doesn't matter if you believe in the prophesy or not because one thing I can say is that Dune Part 2 is a special movie and one that does not come by very often so it needs to be appreciated because there are so many factors that make this a perfect film on it's own and a perfect sequel because facing facts it is better than Dune Part 1 but it is also better than any other movie you will go and see this year, What I am trying to say is that it will take something very special to top Dune Part 2. And with that I cannot wait for Part 3 because I am sure they will do an even better job than what has already been done, goodbye and go and watch Dune Part 2 I implore you an easy 10 out of 10.\n",

It's wafer thin and really stretched out for 2¾ hours. We pick up with \"Paul\" (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the \"Fremen\" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader \"Stilgar\" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give \"Jessica\" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son's ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on \"Chani\" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil \"Baron Harkonnen\" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsgård) has recruited his lethal nephew \"Feyd-Rautha\" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on \"Arrakis\" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of \"Khartoum\" (1966) and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962) with a bit of the \"Phantom Menace\" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya's warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it's bones.

He is a prophet figure, who never wanted war, but he was forced to choose that way because it was the only way. Yet in the final scenes, he \"ordered\" his men to go and fight. He never did anything like this in the books. \"Take them to Paradise\"?? Wtf!2) It was the sister Alia, who despite being child came to Throne Room, killed Baron, threatened Reverend Mother, laughed at Emperor. She achieved many more feats. But she wasn't even born in this movie. Wtf!3) How long is Paul's mother going to be pregnant? How ridiculous this is? Paul was exiled, and then he formed an army, and conquered a planet, yet his mother is still pregnant? Wtf!4) I was most upset by Chani. The book Chani, I love her. She supported Paul the most, She loved Paul so much, She was Paul's everything. They also had a son by this time. Paul married Princess Irulan, but never touched her. Chani understood it was a political marriage, it was to save her planet. Chani in the books is so intelligent, calm, brave and she respects Paul.In the movie, Chani is only making faces on everything Paul is doing.. When every Fremen is supporting Paul, his own wife which is supposed to support him, is against him.. When he ascended to power in the caves infront of all Fremen, she is the only one defying him! Wtf is this character assassination? The ending actually made me like wtf did I watch? My Gf asked me if Chani is going to be against Paul in the next movie, and my only reply was that they assassinated her character.. I need to calm down. Deep Breaths....5) Where is the spice guild? Spice Guild, Emperor and Great Houses, they form the whole power system, each holding 1/3rd of the power. They were shown in the 1st movie when they didn't deviate from books. They had a major role in the throne room negotiations, but Wow! They weren't even in the movie itself!! Wtf!There are some good things also.As I already mentioned, Dune 1 was very good. I recommended that movie to many many people. First half of Dune 2 was also good. Cinematography, Music, the Grandness. But they ruined the second half, especially the ending when it ended on the face of very very angry Chani.They did same with Witcher, with Game of Thrones, they ruined MCU too.

We get it.. he's the \"chosen one.\" It just came off as cliché. And Zendaya is cool, but she's not the caliber of actor that can hold a movie for 3 hours.

The overall plot was lacking big time, without spoiling anything its strongly based on prophecy and leadership, it's very similar to many of the well known historical stories of prophets and their messages, their rise to leadership and power. Unlike history however, the story buildup is weak, the script lacks originality and the whole ( he is the one ! ) scenario have been utilized so many times in films ( for eg, the Matrix ).There are no high stakes, whether or not the protagonist is the One has no major consequences or at least the script failed to highlight it.The movie still has some very solid moments, like the introduction of the main villain with the black and white scenes is fantastic. In fact, the scenes with Villains were more amusing than the protagonists.Acting is decent but nothing spectacular, Zendaya has basically the same angry impression throughout without any clear reason why. She needs to train and work harder on her skills.Timothee Chalamant, is slightly better, but not very impressive. Dave Bautista is under utilized and both his character and Chalamant's scream too much, it's distracting.Speaking of loud, there was also plenty of shouting from the villagers ( i think they are called Fremen ), chanting words like Lasan Algaib and Modeb, these two words probably consumed half the script, repeated over and over, it is exhausting.I know the director wanted to reflect some authenticity with the languages, but the frequent shifting between English and Fremen or whatever its called was another distraction.Probably the chemistry between Zendaya and Chalamant are the worst I've ever seen, i am not sure if its their acting or the script, but it felt forced and predictable.As mentioned earlier, musical score and sounds effects are the highlight of the movie, superb and transfers you into the film as if we are in it. Same with the visuals, the color gradient and atmosphere sucks you into the world of Dune, its such an experience! But after a while, one wants a story arc to keep ones interest high, which lacked.I would probably say the costume design department is the best, definitely impressive style and unique costume designs for almost all characters, could be nominated for best costume design.Action scenes were loud and impressive but lacked tension because as I mentioned there are no high stakes for our protagonist losing. Not to mention, battle scenes are brief and felt rushed. I was expecting epic battles with strategies and action sequences, something like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, but there is no emphasis or focus on the battle scenes, specifically the final battle scene.So yeah, it is ok with some memorable scenes, but left me generally disappointed and I think its over hyped, I do recall liking the first movie more.

It features a lone figure atop a worm, a man trapped by a psychic seduction, and gladiatorial combat on an inhospitable planet. The film is a testament to Denis Villeneuve's 2021 gamble in adapting half of Frank Herbert's foundational sci-fi novel, with no guarantee of a sequel. The film's audacious moments and inhospitable environment make it a must-watch for fans of the genre. In the book \"Dune Messiah,\" the idea of heroic destiny is exposed as a lie created by others for colonization and control. Paul Atreides, a Fremen warrior, arrives on the desert planet of Arrakis, only to discover he is the product of generations of genetic manipulation by his mother, Lady Jessica, and her Bene Gesserit clan. Their work spreads whispers of a prophet, the Lisan al-Gaib, leading the indigenous Fremen people towards freedom. The House of Atreides falls, and Paul and Lady Jessica seek sanctuary and acceptance with a Fremen tribe. Princess Irulan, daughter of the Padishah Emperor, worries about her father's inaction. Herbert wrote the sequel, Dune Messiah, partly in response to those who believed they had failed to grasp the sinister implications of Paul's ascendancy. Villeneuve has expressed his ambition to turn Messiah into a third film, but it is no guarantee. The final third of Part Two emanates pure menace, unlike any other blockbuster in existence. Chalamet and Ferguson's performances in the film are criticized for being overly regal and dignified. Chani plays a crucial role as the moral center, Zendaya, with clarity and resolution. Stellan Skarsgård's Baron Harkonnen returns, and his nephew and heir, Feyd-Rautha, is introduced by Austin Butler. Butler's uncanny Skarsgård impersonation makes the audience question whether his sons Alexander, Gustaf, Bill, and Valter are about to be replaced. Butler's portrayal of Sting in metal underpants and his entire body is a testament to his talent and dedication. Villeneuve's film, Part Two, honors the book's Middle Eastern and North African influences by incorporating Josh Brolin's performance as Paul's mentor, Gurney Halleck, and the use of HR Giger-inspired machines. The film is both grand and intimate, with Hans Zimmer's score and theatre seats rumbling with every cresting sand worm. However, it's crucial not to treat Dune's creative triumphs as a blanket absolution. The Arabic-inspired language of the book is now foregrounded, and onscreen representation is slightly improved, with Tunisian actor Souheila Yacoub playing Shishakli, Chani's closest ally.\n",

Since I only remember the major plot points I wasn't necessarily irked by what appear to be substantial changes in characterization as noted by other reviewers, although I do miss the powerful, lisping child Alia from Lynch's movie. (By the time the kid's born in this movie she's already going to be, like, 3 years old!)Sadly, there was a whole lot of other stuff that was very irksome indeed. I thought the acting was no more than passable, with Chalamet's performance drier than Arrakis itself.The special effects look good but by now gorgeous special effects are par for the course. Although - since so much of the movie took place at dusk or night or indoors - you often couldn't really see much anyway, so there's that.A gripe: How come if you stick a single thumper in the sand in about a minute and a half you've got a huge worm approaching and yet, you can have a few hundred fighters charging in all directions as they fight hand to hand, like so many two-legged hors d'oeuvres... and what? There's only deaf sandworms in that area?And another: What's with all this sword fighting, anyway? You telling me they couldn't invent a projectile gun or a ray weapon that would somehow slow down just at the point of reaching its target so as to enter the vaunted personal force field / aura? Even if not, a lot of the bad guys are shown dying, their force fields dimming as somebody slashes them with a swiftly whizzing sword which is being wielded at such speed that it never should have gotten through the force field at all.Also: The movie is at pains to show (as in the book) that you have to be careful in the desert to \"sand walk\" so as not to attract any worms. Except of course when you don't have to be doing that at all: like during the aforementioned fighting or when somebody may traipse up (and not \"sand traipse\", either) a very high dune (to get yet another glorious view - and is this the first such shot or the 15th milking of same? - into the distance) and apparently no worm can detect it. Maybe they had all just had a really big dinner?All in all I thought it was a pretty boring movie and the first one, while better, wasn't all that exciting, either.

            "Document 490 (Score: 0.0140): Undoubtedly this is a beautiful movie. The costumes, the props (eg. The spice gatherers and carriers, the variety & imaginative designs of ships), some of the desert scenes, and a sense of foreboding prevails throughout, as it should - there may be nominations for it. The music is better and less grating than the first movie. The bits they get right, always the ones that are true to Herbert's book are really good, but... When the obviously struggling scriptwriters depart from that, something even non-readers can detect, it becomes unintelligible and a problem for upcoming plot arcs. More on that later. There is a lot of mumbling, a bit of a modern issue. A good actor effortlessly enunciates to avoid this. Florence Pugh is a bit wooden and her role is wasted - rather than laborious and clumsy explanation between characters, in the book Irulan gives a lot of background, as she is the key historic journal (among others), and that's a great device of Herbert's. In this one they change Alia's arc, make Stilgar into some brainless zealot, miss other key characters and Chani's role is a major change issue. The relationship between her and Paul and his visions of her is a key plot mover throughout, yet they've changed her into some #meToo/racial correction statement that will be very problematic, particularly for the next part. It may be the scriptwriters didn't read far enough ahead. I watched this with my partner and he found it increasingly puzzling, it was embarrassing. Weirdly there was a lot of emphasis on 'fundamentalism' which others and I found uncomfortable. The inevitability of Paul's choices was not clear and made him seem petty and vengeful. I think the main issue above all was the lack of relationship establishment - it may have been script issues, actor choice or performance, direction, I'm not sure. Herbert provides some great quotes which they missed out completely and you feel the lack of them - it leaves a hollow where there could be more substance. In fairness, this was a huge undertaking and visually it's stunning, but the relationships that make you care about the characters was a misfire throughout. I would watch it again (with some fast forwarding I suspect) but it could have been a brilliant classic rather than the puzzling and mixed bag it actually was. Dune remains a difficult book to translate to film, sadly.\n",

            "Document 583 (Score: 0.0138): Let me start by saying I think this is an excellent film but I'm as conflicted as I am impressed.Rather than being the second half of the book adaptation of Dune - this brings in more of the ideological analysis and political power play that exist across the galaxy. The bulk of this might've been influenced by \"Dune Messiah\" but the roles are impacted, changed, squandered, enhanced and fleshed out.For a long film, less book plot transpires from Dune. The film is asking for a part 3, but may have lost a good portion of its fan base with just how far DV has departed or abandoned aspects of the books.No longer are we given a visual or narrated insight into Paul's insight and visions of the past, present and future.His sister remains unborn add therefore her character is developed as a sentient foetus, the victory of taking back Arrakis is swift despite easily taking the entire runtime of the whole of David Lynch's film and giving us more of a sense of her power and precociousness. Her life as as the Dukes daughter and something more is denied in this representation and Chani is transformed to the opposite of her character in the book. For me this choice to \"empower\" Chani's stance to one of understanding beyond her books character means we lost seeing her wisdom and belief. With the time dedicated, her relationship with Paul is left estranged rather than a deep believer. There was time to develop other characters to portray this revisionism and it is largely borrow from the second novel, Dune Messiah. Exploring how the Bene Gesserates seed prophetic stories and female children to manipulate and control the Houses and the reach of their power over 90 generations and more. No montage and voice over used or needed but the passage of time felt long enough to introduce and develop Paul's sister - she is missed most in the last act. While Chani becomes the voice of decent, Josh Brolin as Gurney becomes sycophantic almost.The choices fit our current world tensions somewhat but DV withholds enough of the book to justify a third film. Too much in my opinion to make this a satisfying film.None book readers/listeners and fans will feel short changed from two films of this running time. There was easily more to develop and conclude AND allow for multiple more films. This feels more like a bargaining tool with WB for a franchise.If the internal voice was silenced from Paul it also distances him from the audience. He is less noble and more vengeful. And the final act seems hurried. With critical fights less impressive and certain kills given to the protagonist.So I am finding this a mixed bag with David Lynch giving more accuracy and conclusion of the book's narrative. However, in Hollywood money is made in retention and sequels. DV now has a divergent version of Dune to bring around. The book spawned several official sequels and this could be the money maker that saves WB.The visuals and large scale action is original and bold. Glorious acting by all save Emperor Walken. No gravitas or strategic brilliance on display. I found this weak casting. Austin Butler surprised me.I felt that the Harkonnen perverse natures was underplayed. Partly because since the book was written, homosexuality is not the non-acceptable sensibility it was in Frank Herbert's time. Also I feel that Hollywood wants money to roll in from countries where representation of such meets censorship.The cinematography and the restraint shown with the Worms really pay off. If I had not read the books, I think this would be up there as a 9/10 that I gave the more promising and faithful part one. So if part 3 now happens and works better for these choices as the plot and character arcs continue then this might deserve more praise.As it stands this may have undermined the book fanbase but gained modern audience satisfaction. Could Chani be a willing and understanding concubine knowing she would be his true love but accept a political marriage in this day and age?It certainly leaves lots to be discussed and hopefully more to be seen. I truly hope this is successful and I understand the posture. I can't help but feel two films was sufficient for Dune. Frank Herbert, it could be argued had to write Messiah to capitalise on his own success and to bridge and retrofit Dune to enable Children of Dune. This way perhaps DV has positioned himself more strategically. Does he have the stamina for the journey to continue? I hope the answer is a YES from Legendary and WB.\n",

            "Document 82 (Score: 0.0131): Dune 2 is a big screen action/adventure spectacle the likes of which hasn't been seen since, well, maybe the first Dune in 2021. But when it comes to paying off what the original effort set up so perfectly, this sophomore sequel doesn't quite hit it out of the park.For a very basic overview, Dune 2 picks up with Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) living amongst the Fremen after House Atreides being all but wiped out in the House Harkonnen collaboration with the Emperor's army to re-take Arrakis. Though Jessica and Stilgar (Javier Bardem) continue to tout Paul as the mythical prophesized messiah per the Bene Gesserit religious sect, Paul isn't yet convinced-nor are other Fremen like Chani (Zendaya). Will Paul accept the mantle and risk all-out religious war-or choose to remain embedded \"locally\" with the Fremen? Meanwhile, Baron Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgard) is struggling to control spice production on Arrakis, so unhinged nephew Feyd-Rautha (Austin Butler) is called in for assistance. Finally, the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) scheme to keep themselves in power over all of the machinations.There is absolutely no doubt that Dune 2 is cinema spectacle of the highest order. Director Denis Villeneuve composes a film that should be seen in the biggest format possible (to truly appreciate the scale) and within the best sound structure (Dolby Atmos for me and it was theater-rumbling!). There is never a dull moment from beginning to end-always something interesting to look at or immerse yourself in on screen.Here's the issue with Dune 2: the first film was one of the best world-building setups I've ever seen in a flick. It expertly dropped viewers into the planetary conflict, gradually built up the key characters, and imbued it all with a sense of great mystery and intrigue. While this sequel technically pays off all those setups, it doesn't always do so in the most satisfying or understandable of ways. I won't go into every nook and cranny here, but a few examples:-Paul resists his messianic calling the entire film-until the end when he just \"gives in\"?-The fetus within Jessica is talking to her and will someday grow up to be Anya Taylor-Joy's brief cameo character?-Even after Paul accepts his mantle-the Houses won't acknowledge him?-The bombshell of Paul's more-diverse-than-we-realized bloodline came off as anticlimactic, especially considering how it immediately becomes the driving force of the film's endgame.I know that there is an answer to every question posed above-but none of it felt all that satisfactory or revelatory to me. Part of the problem could be that I was expecting more of a definitive ending and received a \"setting up a franchise\" denouement instead. A particularly telling observation was how my favorite character in the entire movie was Butler's Feyd-Rautha. Why? Because-like in Dune 1-it was something completely different/new and shrouded in mystery that Villeneuve was able to unwind.So, in my final reckoning of Dune 2, the visual spectacle and star-studded cast do most of the heavy-lifting. If you don't see this one from a theater seat at least once, you are doing yourself a disservice. But if you are looking for a plot-tight, perfectly character-fulfilling narrative, you may walk away a little disappointed (at least compared to the first Villeneuve Dune).\n",

It is perhaps the best movie that Hollywood has offered us in recent years, made by the most qualified people. But there is some flaws, even though the voices of people trying to say it are silenced due to the hype that is raging around. Still, I can also say that it is the most deserved hype I have ever seen.The film has two major issue that are related to each other. The first is that the ending of the film is rushed, as if the budget or screen time has run out. The film moves like it jumps from scene to scene without allowing us to enjoy the final climax moment. Thus, the scary sardaukar we saw in the first movie become meaningless. It's a bit like the last season of Game of Thrones here, there is a pacing problem. Honestly, I suspect this feeling was because I was so enthused by the quality of the film at the end so I went crazy for seeing more and more.The second problem is Alia. I understand the difficulty of staging Alia. That's why it was decided to deviate from the book and keep her in the mother's womb throughout the movie. This is a reference that spoils the pacing aspect of the movie, which is smooth except for the last act. While what we see from Paul's and Jessica's experiences is meaningful if it is spread over timeline, this reference point forces it all to have happened in five or six months.It's a problem that shouldn't even be mentioned, but the fact that the Fremen's battle uniforms did not resemble Paul's visions in the first movie made me a little bitter.Dune is a masterpiece in many senses, especially cinematographically. In fact, what the source story says about people, its subtexts and world fiction are amazing. I haven't been this completely immersed in a movie in a long time.

I loved how they made the character of Feyd more meaningful as his place in the grand scheme of things.So, it is not free from some flaws.

These films capture the feel of the novel as not just SF about highly-advanced technology but also about sophisticated societies and mysticism which puts it into the realm of science fantasy as it is sometimes called, similar to \"Star Wars\". Simultaneously, the movie has a superb balance between awe-inspiring wars and the emotions of the main characters. The best description might be the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov meets Lord of the Rings by Tolkien.When \"Dune\" written by Frank Herbert was published in 1965 by Chilton, a publisher mainly of auto repair book manuals no less, nothing like it had ever appeared in SF before. It wasn't only the scope, the action taking place among several politically and culturally sophisticated societies on a planet called Arrakis aka Dune. Some of the novels by Robert Heinlein did have some similar elements. But Herbert brought a new depth which had yet to be explored in SF.Herbert combined several elements which had rarely (if ever) been assembled in a single SF novel before.First, a galactic political structure inspired by the Italian city-states of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. The galaxy is run by an Emperor and twelve noble houses, and the rivalry between the Houses of Atreides and Harkonnen form the core of the events. Paul Atreides, the central character, is the son of Duke Atreides and heir to its rule. Harkonnen is ruled by Baron Harkonnen who gives a new definition to the word \"overweight\". Harkonnen may have been inspired by the Medicis of Florence, and maybe House Atreides loosely inspired by the House of Mocenigo in Venice. Or he simply made each House their own character. Of course the baddies are House Harkonnen, bald albinos, where there is very little individuality, almost like clones.Second, a trade commodity with high demand. Indigenous to Arrakis is the spice Melange, which is only found on Arrakis which makes Dune a prize possession in the galaxy. Melange has both healing and even regenerative capabilities as well euphoric effects making it the most highly-sought-after commodity in the Galaxy.Third, sophisticated societies. On Arrakis there are several cultural societies, some friendly, others more adversarial. There are the Fremen who are native to Dune and divided up into several different groups, one of which believes in the prophecy of a savior while another looks at the world from a more secular view. (Sound familiar?)There is also the Bene Gesserit, an interplanetary matriarchal society with mystique powers. They have elements of a Roman Catholic Convent with those of the Knights Templar. They are mostly nonviolent but use their mystique powers to wield power over the other Houses. Lady Jessica is a Bene Gesserit and Paul's mother.And then a random impediment. What makes mining the spice Melange so challenging is that giant sandworms roam all over Dune. They are about as long as a two tower bridge with a height and width of about six trains. They are attracted by static repeating sounds which makes avoiding them very difficult.All these elements combined into a messianic and militaristic adventure at the highest level. Incredible movie adapted from an incredible book.\n",

            "Document 513 (Score: 0.0128): Well where do I even begin. Review done by @RatedFairly on x.Denis Villeneuve congratulations. This is one of the best movies I have ever watched. It's definetly in my top 15. Maybe top 10 or higher movies of all time. So let's break down whyMusic: Hans Zimmer. Greatest of all time. The music that is portrayed through the film is just perfection. It's fantastic. It's tasty. It's impressive and it's filled with emotions. Every scene tells a tale and a story but with the music it becomes dreamy. Absolutely fantastic to see and feel and hear.Writing: This movie actually follows the books. I haven't personally read the books but many of my close friends has and they all say they are very pleased. From a neutral point of view, the lines, the way the movie and character was shown was fantastic. How certain words and lines, like Javier Bardem put out can fill your head with a much larger picture, is exactly what this movie needs. So well \"world building\". I am just deeply impressed. It wasn't too much comedy or jokes, but the perfect amount that got everyone in the cinema laughing, to people in the cinema crying and being impressed by the scenery.Visuals: Breathtaking. Fantastic. I don't have enough words. Some of the CGI (like 2 or 3 small parts) I found a bit odd but that's just movies for you. The visuals were fantastic. Denis is right. Some scenes you don't need words or lines to portray emotion or set the scene. Music and certain visuals will do it for you. Scary, Epic, Insane, Love. Everything was perfect. I am deeply impressed. Only movie recently with better visuals was Avatar 2 and that says A LOT!!!Characters: I don't want to make this way to long but wow. Timothy killed it. Javier killed it. Austin killed it. Zendaya killed it. Every actor killed it. Stellan was just PERFECT AGAIN!!! Scary as a ...... just fantastic man. So well done. Acting was perfect. Switching between emotions. I have just no words. This movie was just fantastic.Like I put on x, I rate this movie 8.8 out of time. Which is a high for me. I have very few films above 9 but this was one of those that was really close.\n",

Intense is the word for it. All the time.Boy and Mother arrive at desert town, mother drinks blue water, boy passes a test and fights, boy goes south after an attack raises an army and destroys emperor army (the bug battles are awful!), wins sword fight against emperors boy, goes after other houses who refuse him as new emperor.The fact he is related to some of the evil guys isn't interesting. I am your father - but boring.That's it... I almost got a bit bored - except that you can't because its always in your face. Weird feeling.And it is in this sense that the children's movie Star Wars IV-VI suddendly appears more superior. Not that they are comparable. One is sort of a feel good family movie the other is this dark piece that is brutal.But what I mean by thaf is that at least there were different plots and sub stories and ultimately you cared about so many characters.Without naming Star Wars charachter names anyone will remember who I mean when I saytwo robots,a little green being with magical power,anti-hero smuggler and his alien type bear sidekick,a princess and the princethe evil fatherTry that with Dune and it's just a mush of different people fighting, killing servants, or having loud powerful voices.With Dune there is mostly fighting and not much else. And then shortly after I walked out I realised the only character I care a little bit about - but not that much either - is Chani.I didn't care about anything else. I didn't even know what exactly I should care for in the next episode. Should I really care about whether there will be a paradise or not or who will lead the Fremen to it? Is that the point of it? That's it?The best part about the movie is probably that it has strong female lead characters - or at least they're not second to the men.Again its not a bad movie and I was tending between 6 or 7... more towards 7... but at the time of writing it has 8.8 and that's like \"movie of the decade\" type level... way too high.So I just think it has to come down quite a bit ... so for a fairer evaluation giving it a 6.Sorry fabs.\n",
            "Document 837 (Score: 0.0127): Dune: Part One was my favourite movie of 2021. Originally slated to be released in November of last year, this second instalment was delayed due to the SAG-AFTRA strike. So it was with bated breath that I saw it last night in IMAX.Dune 2 is a masterpiece.It has been a very long time since a movie has left me speechless.It is Denis Villeneuve's magnum opus. Very much like how Christopher Nolan crowned his career with Oppenheimer last year, this is Villeneuve's greatest ever movie.Similar to Peter Jackson's, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), Dune 2 represents another evolution of cinema as an art form. I don't use that word lightly.This is the true definition of a vice movie (see 4 Types of Movies tab at the top of homepage). The story locks you in from the opening frame and at just 15 minutes shy of 3 hours, this movie absolutely flies by, not once during it's runtime was I bored.The only downside is my cinema going adventure's of 2024 has peaked with Dune: Part Two, nothing will compare to this movie for the rest of the year.Let's have a Catch up...The story picks up literally in the same frame as part one ended. Dune: Part One and Dune: Part Two have to be seen as one movie split into two, this is not a sequel. If part one was the starter, this is the main course. It makes the first movie better.Paul Atreides (Chalamet) cements his position on Arrakis. He along with his mother Jessica (Ferguson) who herself becomes the Revered Mother start to foresee a prophecy that Paul or to give him is Fremen name Usul will become the saviour of the planet. To reflect this Paul gives himself the name of Muad'Dib, a powerful name on Arrakis.Meanwhile, after Baron Harkonnen continues to lose his grip on Arrakis thanks to the losses at the hands of those \"Rats\" the Freman and the incompetence of his unstable nephew Beast Rabben (Batista), the Baron calls his beloved other nephew Feyd-Rautha (Butler) up to the plate to re-take the planet in his families name and setting the scene for war.So, the best way to review this movie because of it's immensity is to break it down, here goes..CinematographyEvery aspect of how this movie looks is frankly staggering. DP Greig Fraser not only makes each frame look like a stunning photograph, his use of camera angles, lighting and the natural environment is amazing. The battle scenes are jaw dropping and the sense of scale, especially the sand worms in IMAX is eye watering. I had spine tingles for most of the movie.Sound and ScoreThe sound is incredible, as I saw it in IMAX (which I implore you to do if able) leaves you shaken in your seat. You will never forget where and when you first saw and heard those sand worms. The score by the legendary composer Hans Zimmer is equally superb and is used to amazing effect.CastAs for the cast, each member of the star studied line-up absolutely bring their A game to the table. This movie makes Timothée Chalamet a man. Gone is the petulant son of Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac). I think Chalamet is fast becoming this generation's DiCaprio. Zendaya was equally superb as his partner Chiani, as she continues to show that she is one of the leading actresses of her geneartion.After his breakout role in Elvis (2022) and Apple TV+ series Masters of the Air (2024) Austin Butler is a revelation as the psychopathic Feyd-Rautha, beloved nephew to Baron Harkonnen.No Country for Old Men alum Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem resume their respective roles as Gurney Halleck and Stilgar offering gravitas and wise council to the younger cast who take centre stage.Florence Pugh as the emperors daughter Princess Irulan is excellent as is the great veteran actor Christopher Walken (In a small but pivotal role) as the Emperor.My only \"complaint\" as such is that Dave Batista's character Beast Rabben felt under served and was reduced to a bit of a one note character screaming out orders whilst slipping further out of the good graces of his uncle. On that subject, Baron Harkonnen (Skarsgard) himself so central to the original film is also somewhat side lined in this second part of the movie.ActionWhilst I in no way shared this sentiment, there were some people who said Dune: Part One was boring and lacked action. The same cannot be said for this continuing instalment.The action in this movie is breathtakingly shot and choreographed. Whether it was wide scale battles or hand to hand combat it felt exhilarating, organic and primal.Special EffectsA seamless blend of top drawer CGI and jaw dropping practical effects. Effortlessly combined with filming on location in Abu Dhabi.Impact on CinemaDune: Part One and Dune: Part Two, is this generations Star Wars. It however goes further than that, it is Star Wars for grown-ups. There is nothing Disney has done with Star Wars to rival or even come close to Villeneuve's incredible movie. It makes the recent MCU and DC movies look what they are, light weight tensionless candy floss poop.What Villeneuve has achieved here is simply staggering.It reminds you of why the medium of cinema exists.It is a science fiction masterpiece.Denis Villeneuve and team deserve all the adulation, box office success and awards they can get.Verdict - Unmissable.\n",

Instead, the film was more concerned with getting from one action setpiece to the next without much thought given to why or how. This leaves many scenes and character actions feeling disjointed or confusing. Gone is the internal logic of the story, replaced with raw justification for spectacle. The lore of the world is not expanded, instead it somehow shrinks as characters are killed off or have their agency stripped away for the sake of the plot with the only real new information being about the water of life (which is poorly explained with its relationship to spice and the worms, not to mention Jessica's unborn daughter).Too much wasted time for such a long film. I would normally be more generous and give it a 7 but this is far from the perfect movie it's being praised to be and even farther from a perfect science fiction movie.\n",

There is also a lot of talking in this movie and not much action, basically action scenes are over quickly and there isn't much buildup to the last battle which again is over so ridiculously quickly and all the duels also are over so quick so I just couldn't immerse myself or feel the significance of things happening on screen because it was like a speed run of many events which I hate.

But surely thing might have been different if he was on board.They changed the color palette also from the first movie.it was a little bluish in the first part which suited it but here they changed it and it looks quite different.It goes on with slow story telling and becomes really fast paced in the last 30 or 45 minutes.I am not saying it's a bad movie but what you expect after watching the first part it's not at that level.Behaviour of characters was also one dimensional and wasn't explored properly. Maybe because they had to fill so many things in 2.45 hours of time.You know extended version of 4 hours would work for this movie because there is so much to add or explain.But as we know it would never come out.Rest acting,music, cinematography all are good like the first part.You will like it but after it will be over you will be left with a feeling of something missing out from it.Let's hope the next part would be much more thrilling than this one.I believe in Denis Villeneuev and he is one of the best director of our time and i will watch whatever he will make.\n",

Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie 3 years ago just as well.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winner and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.The movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1 however in my opinion could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in Dune: Messiah, which I really hope will get green-lit soon.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed right now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented agains this Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, perhaps it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.\n",

With amazing storytelling and music that immerses you in this sci-fi, fantazy world. The most beautiful scenery and images in every scene. And acting that just can't be complained about. But the story suffers from poor character writing in some parts.SOUNDS AND SOUNDTRACK: I saw the movie in the cinema with Dolby Surroundsound and it was one of the greatest experiences with sound i have had. Hans Zimmer made a track that is unique and fitting the genre of sci-fi, and the setting. I will definitely check out the soundtrack later.STORY AND STORYTELLING: The story fit in extremely well with its precursor and very few if any bad kliches. It was thought out, thought provoking, and emotionally provoking. There was very little i thought could have been done differently: Paul's sudden change of heart regarding being leader, felt dissatisfying as he had no inner conflict with his choices or embarassment towards Chani. The death of Rabban i thought was too fast, being done in only 3 or 4 moves, with little to no emotional satisfaction. The twist of the baron being his grandfather felt a little unasked for. But if it plays a bigger role in the third installment, it won't be a problem. And lastly the death of Feyd Rautha. I enjoyed Austin Butlers character enormesly and didnt like seeing him die. But also think that his death was very well writin and epic. I no longer see Austin Butler for his role as Elvis.THE PACING: It felt very thought through and worked well on the big screen. It really gave way for us to enjoy the stunning images, without feeling forced. Though i wanted more of Paul and Chani's chemistry, and a scene with Paul telling her about his visions of her. I think that would have shown their tight bond, and make the ending even more heart crushing.FINAL RATING: 9,3\n",

The arena fight between Austin Butler and the last Atreides Robert Yuan (actors names) was fantastic. The battles with the harvesters were phenomenal.The script, however, left me a little bit disappointed. What about the Guild Navigators? And how were the worms used after they came through the pass in the mountains opened up by the atomics? There was only one sequence of the initial charge (marvelous sequence when the gunships entered) but then nothing. The Sardurkar were not given enough respect in this film. There was only one scene that showed them respect and that was when they rose up from the fallen sand and rock debris and stood their ground preparing for the oncoming onslaught instead of panicking. Other than that I felt the film should have spent more time on tactical combat scenes in what was supposed to be an epic battle at the end of the film, maybe trim time off of the other dragged out sequences in the film. The first movie did a better job with the Sardaukar, you actually feared them. The epic battle at the end of this movie was less than epic. And poor Bautista, they should not have made him act like such a wimp, should have had a more glorious fight even in retreat.As much as I like Walken, I thought he was poorly cast to be Emperor. The 1984 film had a perfect actor for the personality. This is Villeneuve's fault, he picked him.The script also fails to emphasize that Paul is the Kwisatz Haderach at the end of the movie. Paul's initial ability to vaguely see the future comes from the centuries of genetic tinkering of the women of the Ben Gesserat, but after he drinks the water of life and not only survives but develops the ability to see an individual's past, as evident by the scenes in the Fremen temple where he looks at individuals and describes their past, and more clearly sees optional future outcomes, and after he actually fulfills all of the prophecies of the Fremen, the story is true, he really is the Messiah of Arrakis, justifying the religion, and he really is the Kwisatz Haderach, a man with abilities that no other man has. But the film appears to gloss over this. Shame. He is not just some populist charismatic man blamed by the likes of Zendaya's character for (perceived) fooling anyone to follow him and falling for the appeal of power and giving up his principles, he is more than that.My critique of the first film was not enough emotion, well part 2 does a better job, especially after Paul survives the water of life and becomes the anti-hero, all hell breaks loose. And Zendaya's character being a more independent women than the 1984 film was interesting, albeit the combat skills or luck were not realistic unless you buy that the Sardaukar were that inept. Part 1 was a better drama than part 2, but part 2 has some great action sequences, besides the disappointments I mentioned earlier. Not a perfect film for this Dune 1984 admirer.\n",

It's a story that demands an extremely complex adaptation for a film that, combining both parts, runs around 340 minutes, but Denis Villeneuve managed to capture the essence of Frank Herbert's literary work and gave us the best sci-fi film in history.\n",

Most of what was set up on the story and character front is paid off to some degree here. The battle sequences are incredible and creative in places. I think it's safe to say that if you liked the first movie, you'll like this one. BUT, it's easier to admire than to love, with the characters at arms' length, even by the time the credits rolled.

Before watching the movie, I read many praising articles and reviews, but none of them could prepare me for the reality of it. Dune Part Two delivers exactly what it promises - a bold adaptation of one of the greatest novels ever written. It's a tragic story of extreme superstitions that can cause even the most pure-hearted leaders to descend into chaos. The film starts with an incredible sequence showcasing the astonishing use of technology by the Harkonnens and the Fremen's insane harmonization with their planet. The Fremen take down their opponents swiftly and unnoticed, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer. The investment into the rest of the film only increases from that moment on. Denis Villeneuve has done it again and this time, he has hit a home run. Collaborating with one of the greatest cinematographers of our generation, Greig Fraser, Denis has produced a monumental piece of cinema. It not only surpasses the previous installment in every aspect but also reinvents science fiction itself. With its skillful use of practical sets, lighting, and digitized effects, this modern cinema masterpiece serves as a definitive masterclass for anyone aspiring to be a great filmmaker. Although the visual and audio effects in the movie are impressive, they do not distract from its main focus, which is the storytelling. The film follows a love story that defies all odds, as Paul assumes the role of the Messiah, Chani struggles to keep her mind clear of myths and falls in love with someone who is lost not only in the desert but in his heart as well. In the first act, Paul's character undergoes significant changes. He tries to distance himself from his mother's actions by joining the Fremen's cause to liberate their planet from tyranny. However, he remains unaware that Jessica's plan is already in progress. Despite this, the first act remains a charming distraction from these developments. The empire is in a state of despair as the Fremen successfully destroy the Harkonnen spice reserves one by one. This has pushed the Bene Gesserit to their limits, and as a result, the Baron has deployed his most valuable weapon, Feyd Rautha. The second act of the story mainly focuses on how to introduce a villain and make him memorable. And to top it all off, Denis created perhaps the greatest third act in existence. In the end, Paul finally realizes what he has to do. He takes the Water of Life and opens his mind to such an extent that he becomes aware of the destruction he is about to cause, but proceeds anyway. By doing so, he loses his one true love, yet he stands his ground in an incredible hand-to-hand combat and eventually to a holy war with him as an Emperor. Once again, Hans Zimmer's astonishing otherworldly soundtrack elevates this cinematic experience to uncharted hype territories. I highly recommend watching this film in 70mm IMAX print, if possible.Let's all hope that Dune Messiah will become a reality.\n",

The first Dune may have focused on the set-up but that doesn't mean this one is rushing straight into the action, maintaining that immersive slow burning nature.Timothée Chalamet got a nice journey in the original, however this one is so much bigger. He plays the internal conflict so well as he tries his best to avoid his destiny and by the end he feels like a different person entirely in a way that doesn't come out of nowhere. In those earlier moments he also displays palpable chemistry with Zendaya as they begin to truly connect.As well as having that strong chemistry with Chalamet, Zendaya is given so much more to do here (as promised), essentially becoming co-lead. As the film descends further in its climactic moments, she remains the only one who's able to see through the manipulation that's happening with a fair few moments where her looks of frustration say everything.There are so many huge names in this cast that don't get much in an impactful way. All of them are fully committed to their smaller parts with Austin Butler being a major highlight. The film describes him as psychotic and honestly that's putting it mildly. His deliberate impersonation of the Baron really works to make him even more unsettling.It's clear from its first major action sequence, bathed in a beautiful orange hue, that director Denis Villeneuve is a master of the craft at this point. Even compared to Part One, the scale of this chapter is immense with returning cinematographer Greig Fraser bringing his specific set of skills to make this an undeniable cinematic event.Considering how good his previous score was, Hans Zimmer could've easily coasted for this one by just reusing all of those themes but it's obvious that he wouldn't do that because he clearly loves playing in this sandbox.

It has marvelous special effects and computer graphics, action packed scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat with those realistic looking explosions and people falling left and right, but what it also has some significant downsides that diluted my otherwise good perception of this movie.But let's start with the good things first.The cast is exceptional. From the main characters to the extras. I liked the fact that they made all factions in this movie look and feel distinct with different languages, names, costumes and coor schemes. With cast of well-known actors such as Christopher Walken, Zendaya, Dave Bautista I especially want to commend the acting of Timothée Chalamet, the scene where Paul Atreides proclaimed himself as the Prophet and the Leader of the Fremens really gave me goosebumps.The sound design in this movie is superb. Whether it's the sound of hot blazing desert, sand blasting the face of the main character when he mounts a desert worm, explosions, gunshots, swords clashing, make your adrenaline levels go through the roof, making you feel like it's you who's fighting there.Special effects and computer graphics are simply gorgeous.

Even though Harkonnen possess aviation, machine guns, long range sniper rifles, rockets and they just get slaughtered in the open in melee fights without even giving much resistance? And we supposed to think that they are some kind of warrior caste? A huge let down in that department. Problem with this is that they don't seem too much of a formidable enemy and because of that stakes are low. From the start of the movie when Fremens just completly utterly destroy squad of Harkonnens without any losses we just know that Paul Atreides and Fremens aren't in any trouble fighting these guys, which makes battles not that interesting. The Batista's character death was very underwhelming and a huge letdown. The fight itself was less than 10 seconds and as I just mentioned before, very one-sided. The one and only decent fight was between Paul and Feyd-Rautha, the stakes very high and it was a very beautifully choreographed fight.The second problem is that Paul Atreides abilities feel undeserved. He barely escaped with his life in the first movie, and in the second he just starts dropping harkonnens left and right, and in the finale even gains some kind of godlike ability that lets him see past, future and read minds. Kind of Mary Sue character.As a conclusion I would like to say that it was a solid movie and I enjoyed it wholeheartedly and if you wonder what to watch on the week end, I would gladly recommend you this flick.\n",

Obviously, technically these films are splendid (very impressive visually, it's well written and the fight between Paul and Feyd was well thought out.) - it's Denis Villeneuve, all the same. But even if I have not read the original work of Frank Herbert, it seems to me that it is the real problem with any cinematographic adaptation of this saga. The original work lacks conceptual depth and is too predictable. To have a truly interesting Dune film, we would have to take more liberties with the original work which is too old. In this work, there is misogyny (Paul who takes a woman without even caring what she thinks), a lot of deus ex machina, a lack of seriousness (the harkonnen are supposed to be a big threat, but when we look at their leader and Beast Rabban...), etc. Besides, it is unjustifiable that Paul is forced to marry the famous girl.In addition, these two films have a real major flaw: the main actor. T. Chalamet doesn't have what it takes to play a character who is a great fighter and a leader of a nation. He is too puny, he does not have the build of a fighter (for example, Channing Tatum at the same age as him had the charisma for this type of character).Brief !

Building upon the foundation laid by its predecessor, this installment delves deeper into the complexities of power, prophecy, and the perilous nature of heroism.The narrative resumes just after the fall of House Atreides on Arrakis, orchestrated by the secret machinations of Emperor Shaddam IV and House Harkonnen. Despite the devastation, Paul Atreides and his mother Jessica manage to escape, finding refuge among the native Fremen. The Fremen, believing in the prophecy of a savior known as Lisan Al Gaib, come to see Paul as their potential messiah. However, as Paul seeks to rally the Fremen for revenge against the Emperor and House Harkonnen, questions arise about his true nature and destiny.Director Denis Villeneuve's masterful execution elevates every aspect of the film, from the breathtaking visuals to the nuanced performances. Timothée Chalamet's portrayal of Paul Atreides is a mesmerizing blend of vulnerability and authority, while Zendaya's Chani serves as a poignant anchor amidst the turmoil. The chemistry between them adds depth to their star-crossed romance, enriching the emotional beats of the story.The supporting cast delivers standout performances, with Javier Bardem's Stillgar providing moments of levity amid the tension. Bardem's portrayal infuses the character with a blend of wisdom and humor. Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen emerges as a chilling antagonist, his off-the-rails psychosis portrayed with chilling authenticity. The hand-to-hand combat scene between Rautha and Paul, though brief, is a testament to Butler's prowess as an actor and the film's meticulous choreography. Also Rebecca Fergusion as Jessica, Stellan Skarsgard as Vladimir Harkonnen and Batista as Rabban Harkonnen deliver incredible performances.The film's exploration of religious fundamentalism adds another layer of complexity to its narrative. As Stillgar fervently believes in Paul's divine role as the savior, and the Bene Gesserit manipulate prophecies to serve their own agenda, the dangers of blind faith and fanaticism are laid bare. Villeneuve's deft handling of these themes adds depth and urgency to the story, inviting viewers to reflect on the nature of belief and its consequences.Greg Fraser's cinematography deserves special mention for its stunning visuals, which capture the vast and treacherous landscapes of Arrakis with breathtaking beauty. Moments like Paul's first ride atop a majestic Shai Hulud are a sight to behold, showcasing Fraser's mastery in bringing the world of Dune to life on the screen.Dune is incomplete without its music, scored masterfully by Hans Zimmer. He has given uncountable iconic themes in the past and yet he manages to score another gem which will surely become the new benchmark for such out-wordly adventure movies.\"Dune: Part 2\" is not merely a spectacle; it is a dark and dense story that demands the viewer's full attention. To fully appreciate this movie, viewers must watch Part 1 and pay close attention to every word spoken on screen. This is not a film to be taken lightly; it is an immersive experience that rewards careful observation and reflection.One of the most goosebumps-inducing moments comes when Timothée Chalamet's Paul Muad'dib Usul Atreides uses the Voice with chilling authority, screaming 'Silence' to a character. It's a testament to Chalamet's commanding presence.Christopher Nolan must count his lucky stars that \"Dune: Part 2\" faced delays, allowing his film \"Oppenheimer\" to shine during the awards season. Villeneuve's masterpiece would have undoubtedly overshadowed many contenders with its unparalleled grandeur and depth, solidifying Villenueve's status as a true sci-fi genius.Dune Part 2 is Monumental, Malevolent and Captivating, a true sci-fi movie of a Generation. \"Long live the Fighters\".Cannot recommend highly enough to be watched on an IMAX screen.\n",

Even the iconic moment of riding the sandworm seemed a bit rush and then when the moment arrived it was a bit of a let down. Don't get me wrong, visually appealing and great technical work. But the story which was written by a grand master of Science Fiction was given short shift. Hard to believe that in an almost 3 hour movie a lot of what made Dune great was given rudimentary mention or skipped all together.

The problem is that quantity does not compensate for the loss of the surprise effect.In fact, the story is just an excuse for an interminable exhibition of close-ups of the incredibly beautiful faces of the female cast, no less beautiful desert sceneries, and an interminable succession of sand worm ridings.Flat and hollow aesthetics, with a really poor storytelling. The story is confusing, with a first act focused in the Fremen, but with no real advance of the story, just Fremen in the desert, Fremen worshiping the mesiah, Fremen riding worms, worshiping again, Chani frowning at the inmensity of the desert with deep music, and so on (actually, Chani spent all movie frowning). Actually, the first act was terribly boring.Then, the abuse of ellipsis makes the story rush forward, to the point of losing sense sometimes. It is really difficult to follow it without any previous knowledge of what happened in the original novel.This rush lead to weird situations, as when suddenly Chani shows up out from nowhere in a ornithopter, and you ask yourself why and how she ended flying that thing.The rush to close the story causes the last act to be resolved hastily and sloppily. The expected final battle is resolved very quick and lacking epic and glory. The supposedly powerful and fearsome Sardaukar appears in the last battle as a few random guys without any combat abilities. The formerly powerful emperor and Harkonnen, are now weak and do not stand a chance against the new dark mesiah and their fundamentalist troops.Overall, the movie lost all the magic and mistery of the first part, and it is just an exhibition of style from a director that seems to be more in love with himself than with the story he is telling.About acting, all the cast are doing a great job. Special mention to the superb Javier Bardem, who, together with Zendaya, support all the movie on their shoulders. All the Harkonnen are doing a great job and are the most interesting characters, both in acting and aesthetically. To me, Paul Atreides is the worst part, plain and lacking substance and the you could expect from the leader of a holy war against a galactic empire.In summary, a pretentious sequel larguely inferior to the first part in all aspects.\n",
            "Document 47 (Score: 0.0113): Before you call Dune Part II 'the best Sci-fi movie' or even just a 'masterpiece' try and consider the 5 bullet points I've made below - you might even end up agreeing with some of them ;)Beforhand let me just point out that the movie was extraordinary beautifully filmed with goosebumpy music added to a dozen of memorable shots, hence the good rating. So yeah, it is a great movie with great acting. It's actually a really good movie. But that has been pointed out by a LOT of people already. Let me tell why this isn't in the 10/10 league.1. The major problem: Pacing. 2 parts of the movie, which could have been legendary, ended up being rushed: The battle of the Sardaukar and Fremen and Paul's first time riding the Worm-metro.You don't have to be a criticizer of the movie to admit, that the last fight with Fremen and Sardaukar was so shy of what it could have been. The fremen just sweeps away the emperor's army (I mean come on) in around 10 minutes of screentime. This is what the whole movie leads up to. 10 minutes. And not 10 nail-bittering minutes with an epic battle. Just 10 minutes of one side slaughtering the other. I get that they took them by surprise, but please. It would have added film value to get a tense fight, where you actually wonder whether or not they will succeed. Instead of getting a edge-of-your-seat moment, we got the predictable outcome. It feels like Denis was told to compress the last 1/3 of the film - making it as anticlimactic as possible.The sandworm-ride did make a good scene, but you don't actually see any training whatsoever. So instead of getting psyched up by him succeeding, you end up thinking; could he do this all the time?2. Paul's metamorphose to become the chosen one - or rather the absence of it. Why can't this guy admit that there might be something to the prophecy. I get that his humility is what makes him adequate for the part, but because of his continuing denial of the prophecy, we as audience too lose faith in him as the Kwisatz Haderach. Which, just like the incident of him learning to sandworm-ride, makes an unfulfilling, anticlimactic and awkward transition.3. The weak villains. I was expecting a lot from the villain-side, after Dune 1 where the emperor and baron felt clever and sly. Feyd had a great portrayal in the movie though, but the rest of them seemed frivolous. Seriously, how did the emperor manage to keep his throne for that long, with an army, that with a little surprise, breaks like glass. And Rabban is apparently just a joke despite him actually being sort of scary in Dune 1.In general the Harkonnens seem off by a lot! They get toyed around on multiple occasions, and we in the audience never actually see them as a threat due to their weak portrayal. (We mostly see them kill poor employees)4. Chani and Paul had zero romance. Sorry, but it's true. I want to see them as this meant-to-be couple, but we literally only see them bonding a couple of times. I made the assumption that Chani must be bi-polar; the girl is crazy careful and suspicious of other people several times in the movie, but starts a relationship with Paul based on 2-3 scenes with interaction. People on Tinder tend to talk more with each other before jumping into bed than these two.5. The political aspect - or once again the absence of the same. We hear about these other houses as dangerous and powerful, but where are they? As a viewer who hasn't read the books, I do not have the slightest idea of what these other houses are capable of. This is probably the main reason of the incomplexity of the plot. We don't any political reflections or responses, despite the fact that it must mean a great deal! Without the tangled political game (which I guess is pretty damn important in a world run by houses) the plot becomes predictable on a level which compares to most superhero-movies.Imagine that we had seen the other houses and their beautiful planets. Now THAT would be sci-fi in its glory!!Consider that I had so much against the storytelling (which is the fundamental part of a film) yet still gave it 8/10. I'm surely also going to see it in theaters at least one more time. That goes to show how brilliant the cinematography actually was! Worth watching, not praising.\n",

I don't mind not having every little thing spelled out for me in a movie, but there were nearly a dozen times where I thought, \"Wait, did I miss something? What happened between the previous scene and this one?\"I honestly have to wonder if the original was a far longer cut of the film, and the studio made the director cut it way down for distribution.

As a cinephile who always looks for the visuals of a film, this movie outshined itself. It captured the whole environment depicted in the novel series. It was a breathtaking experience because it is quite rare to watch movies that were taken in a deserted place taking place in a different world. The appearance of the sandworm, or shai-hulud, made an impact. Its colossal magnitude shook the whole theater like I was there riding it. The scenes in Giedi Prime were cool, including the battle scene with Feyd. With its brutalist architecture and the monochrome color grading, it's so atmospheric.With the ability of Hans Zimmer to describe emotions through music, the score resonates with the mystique of the Dune universe. It triggers awe for something so unworldly, but mixed with a warning of imminent danger, it totally fits the movie's narrative.The writing also still landed. The great pacing connected it to the previous film and made a path for the movie's direction. I sat for 2 hours straight and never felt any boredom at all; it made me more excited. The build-up to the climax was crazy. Fleshing out new characters and adding them for more political turmoil and hindrances up to the final battle between Paul and Feyd, it was intense and menacing.The mixture of real-world cultures of Middle Eastern countries blends well with the theme of the movie, which was all about foreign colonizers using fear and faith as their tool to control. The theme made me question my reality. \"How are we going to believe?\" Are we just going to wait until a prophecy is fulfilled, or are we going to make it a reality? The movie warned me about the danger that a false belief could pose.Thank you, Denis Villeneuve, for carrying the new generation of sci-fi genre films and the whole of Hollywood itself.

He flips some things around (I'm pretty sure), but otherwise delivers a handsome, exciting, second half to what he had started. And then he highlights Chani way too much, changing her character so much that she sticks out like a sore thumb to curious purposes that do little more than distract from what's going on around her. Seriously, if the final twenty seconds of this film were chopped off and lost in a fire, I'd actually be a good bit more positive on the film.Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) and his mother the Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) have joined the Fremen led by Stilgar (Javier Barden). Paul grows close to Chani (Zendaya) who helps teach him the ways of the desert as they go into hiding from the dominant Harkonnen led by the Baron (Stellan Skarsgard), his elder nephew Rabban (Dave Bautista) left as governor of the desert planet Arrakis while the Baron continues to groom his younger nephew Feyd (Austin Butler) towards leadership. Operating as an exposition dump for those who didn't remember the first film is Irulan (Florence Pugh), nominally taking up her chronicling duties from the book (her entries marking the start of every chapter), while her father, the Emperor Shaddam IV (Christopher Walken), quietly ruminates on the implications of his plan to eradicate the Atreides perhaps failing.This is one of those stories that I know so well, that I kind of assume that everyone knows. And yet, Dune, for all it's popularity among scifi nerds, isn't the grand cultural touchpoint it's sometimes made out to be. Its influences are strong and wide, but the actual story knowledge isn't.Anyway, now's the time to talk about some creative choices. The first that screams out to me is how much more stylized visually the film is. The film opens with a scene of Harkonnen troops attacking the Fremen in the desert, and Villeneuve uses a partial eclipse as an excuse to bathe the entire scene in a deep orange. It's really nice to look at. I've been curious about the black and white segments in the trailers since I've seen them, and the explanation is that Geidi Prime has a black sun making it so that outside just looks like that. Knowing more from the books, I'd say that the whole Harkonnen look is something I'd attribute more to the Bene Tlielax, but it's at least interesting to see.There's a heavy emphasis on the Bene Gesserit and their breeding program in here, which I appreciate. I think that most heavily gets highlighted in the inclusion of Lady Margot Fenring (Lea Seydoux), a Bene Gesserit sent to Geidi Prime to seduce Feyd, secure his bloodline, and learn how to manipulate him should certain probabilities arise. She is very briefly seen in a modified form in the Sci-Fi Channel series, but otherwise she's never made an appearance in an adaptation. Although, unless Villeneuve is planning on using material from the sequel novels written by Brian Herbert (please no), Lady Fenring shouldn't be making any more appearances, making this feel like something of a dead end that still manages to provide some nice detail in terms of worldbuilding.And that leads me to the editing. I like how much detail gets brought in to help fill out the world (universe) of Dune, but there are some places where the film feels too fast. Take, for instance, the jump from Paul and Chani sitting on a dune watching a wormrider in the distance, Chani explaining to Paul that he'll never become a rider because he's not really Fremen. Cut ahead to about fifteen minutes later in screentime, there's been no mention of Paul training or anything, and now it's time for Paul to ride his first worm. Time has obviously passed, and this feels like the instance of a cut scene that was deemed unnecessary. However, considering how much time gets dedicated to Fenring's seduction of Feyd, it makes you wonder if the priorities were in total alignment when cutting the film down to its current length.So, Paul stays in the northern parts of Arrakis to lead the small revolt of the Fedaykin fighters against the Harkonnen while Jessica, pregnant and having become the Fremen's Reverend Mother through the changing of the Water of Life from poison into a harmless drink (no orgy in this mostly sexless adaptation), a process that awakens her unborn daughter, Alia, into consciousness. Gonna be honest, Jessica talking to Alia outloud is great. It's just the right kind of funny in this universe. Anyway, Jessica becomes a fanatic in the pursuit of Paul's legend as the Mahdi, the Lisan al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World, while Paul resists it. If I remember correctly, this is something of a complete reversal where Paul easily fell into the legend to help him fight while Jessica saw it as something of a survival mechanism, an unfortunate path she had to take to stay alive. I don't mind this change because Furgeson as a madwoman is great to watch.Things escalate. The Emperor must come to Arrakis. There is a showdown, and that showdown is great. It reminded me of the epic ending to James Cameron's Avatar, a movie I have no great love for but which, I cannot deny, has a freaking awesome final act action sequence. Atomics, worms, giant spaceships, it all comes together in an action and special effects extravaganza that Villeneuve manages with aplomb. It's great fun.Now, Chani. Chani is given extra prominence, and I really don't like how they did it. She is one of the Fremen who does not believe in the Lisan al-Gaib, and she sticks to that belief through everything she witnesses. As Paul is presenting all of the signs, as Chani herself is becoming part of the prophecy that she rejects through literal actions, she not only resists, but she fights back against it. It's so out of place, and it goes through to the end of the film. Sure, Herbert having Chani blithely accept that the love of her life is going to marry an imperial princess for power was always a bit thin, but turning the ending of the film into watching her pouting is just wrong.The story of Dune is Paul going from boy to man to leader to godhead. It's not Chani being mad that Paul is going from boy to man to leader to godhead. Ending on her was a mistake.Anyway, it's a spectacle. I think it gets the heart of Herbert's message right. It mixes things up to some degree and to not entirely successful effect. As an adaptation of Dune, I think the Sci-Fi miniseries is probably the best, but as a filmed experience, this is the more exciting and complete of the three attempts.\n",

I find that this installment of the series picks up its pace quickly and reaches its peak near the end of the film. Contrary to the first film where most of the action was packed into the middle. Dune: Part Two displays a more relaxed tone from the start to the middle of the movie, however the mood shifts to match the occasion and finally leaves you somewhat distraught as the consequences of the character's choices surely lead to a path they cannot return from. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is once again fantastic the mixture of his naturalistic style and the sci-fi genre leads to a grounded universe while still retaining the wonderous and whimsical aspects of science fiction, each decision on how planets and characters are portrayed demonstrates the care and attention paid to how audiences interpret them, you understand the Harkonnen, the Emperor, the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit and the remnants of house Atreides in one look at the way they are shown. The score is once again sublime, Hans Zimmer once again proves himself as the definitive motion picture composer, his ability to craft larger-than-life scores with his ability to understand the differences between each character and culture present in this film is nothing short of perfection, recurring themes and motifs are present throughout the movie and paired with the visuals and the performances, which are also incredible, form a modern day masterpiece crafted meticulously by masters of their respective fields.

I just wish he were better at telling a story.His 'Blade Runner 2049' was also gorgeous, but it suffered from being cold, soulless and without any real sense of purpose.

And I don't know if they had to keep the movie short, but I felt like they should have put more power and time in to the main characters. It went by way too fast in my opinion. Like they were in a rush. The first movie was nice and slow, intense and beautiful scenes. This one felt like a quickie. Paul received super powers immediately and had the emperor on his knees. An emperor which we barely saw, only had a few scenes we can count on one hand. Also at the end I expected a tougher battle, an emperor showing up with a few hundreds of soldiers, didn't make any sense, was so easy overthrown. They could have make it more exciting. I mean it wasn't a bad movie. It was enjoyable just very fast. They should have put at least half an hour or more in the film. And take their time with the characters, Paul's mother, the emperor, the Harkonnen's maybe some epic lines that Paul's father said in the previous one. More dialogue at the end. Didn't avenge his father enough. It was in and out. Anyways good movie, I hope the next one they will take their time more.\n",

As an early 2024 movie release, much of its impact will be gone by the time the next awards season arrives, but true film fans will recognize it as a top contender for the year's best, even if we've got more than a half year to go yet as I write this. Visually, the picture is more than impressive, however I was expecting more from the scenes of the Shai-Hulud, the giant sand worm that the story's hero summoned to demonstrate his acceptance as the Muad 'Dib of the Fremen people, 'The One Who Points the Way'. The one Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) rode was all but invisible, contrasted with those scenes in which a sand worm engulfed enemies of the Fremen earlier in the picture, reminiscent of Jabba the Hutt's favorite pet Sarlacc from \"Star Wars\".One thing that seemed ambiguous was the relationship between Paul and Chani (Zendaya). At times her facial and body language showed disapproval with Paul, even as they expressed their undying love for each other. I can only attribute that to the fact that Paul was an outsider to the Fremens, and his stature as the future Lisan al-Gaib might have been considered heretical. Even so, her obvious disapproval with Paul at various times felt out of place, except near the end when Paul expressed his willingness to marry Princess Iluran (Florence Pugh), daughter of the Emperor (Christopher Walken) right after he told Chani he would love her forever. At that point it felt like Paul was acting more on his own behalf in a quest for power than what was appropriate for the Fremens.A major surprise for this viewer was the casting of Austin Butler in the role of Feyd-Rautha, nephew of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Stellan Skarsgård). I didn't recognize the 'Elvis\" actor in his albino guise as the promised future Emperor. Once again, in terms of an ambiguous outcome, I couldn't perceive how Paul reversed his enemy's knife to defeat Feyd-Rautha in the final contest for the Emperor's throne. And finally, how we've gotten this far into the story to find out only now that Paul's mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) was a Harkonnen was quite troubling. How would Paul's deceased father not have known, and consequently, the viewer. That twist sort of defied one's understanding of the relationships among the principal characters.Lastly, where one might have expected a definitive resolution to the Dune saga, the story leaves threads hanging with the impending birth of the mystical baby girl carried by Reverend Mother Jessica, and the fierce resolve of Chani in abandoning Paul. I had not gone beyond the original Frank Herbert \"Dune\" novel myself, and this film's conclusion points me in the direction of following up with 'Dune Messiah\".\n",

One of the main plots is that the Space Guild Navigators need spice to fold space and allow travel between the systems. No where to be found in this movie. So, for those who didn't read the books. Spice comes across as a drug used like cocaine in the movie. You have no sense of urgency because if the \"Spice must flow\" is stopped. It's the end of the empire.Second, what a waste of of Christopher Walken. He comes across as the enfeebled emperor of the houses. The urgency for the emperor going to Dune is because he doesn't want Paul to tell the other houses about his betrayal? WHAT? I guess since you didn't bring in the Space Guild Navigators you had to invent another reason? Did Christopher's contract stipulate that he only wears robes or did they run out of money for his costumes? At the end of movie he looks like a homeless person walked on set. What was also missing was the pressure by the Witches and the Space Guild on the emperor to continue with spice production. Christopher was less menacing and more like 'Grandpa' needs to go to the memory care facility.Third, I knew the movie was in trouble when I looked at my watch and realized \"There's only nine minutes left in this move, how are they going to end it?\". I felt the movie was rushed to reach a conclusion and the ending battle was chaotic and short. Chaotic in not a good way. There is a whole scene about 'the atomics' that made me question on why is it in the movie? We are told about the 'atomics', but there is no follow-up to the ending battle. The fierce emperor warriors come across as incompetent wimps. The ending seemed way to rushed. It's less about a powerful emperor and more like 'how did none of the other houses not take him out?'.There are other problems that are pretty minor, like nothing is mentioned at all about the other systems. Like the Mentat's or the planet of machines. Too much time spent on 'Fade' killing people in an Arena, but failing to mention who these characters are. If you hadn't seen the first film, there deaths make no sense. Robands death seemed like an after thought. Like we need to get rid of this character, but the movie is going on too long. But, my primary complaint is the lack of 'Space Guild Navigators\" and why Spice is so important to these people.

That magic was created by artists, those in front and behind the camera eye. Each one of those artists have their own code, their voice in the choir of picture makers, a variety of tricks on their sleeves. Movies today, specially mainstream films, apply just one code, one voice, one trick: the capitalist one. Exceptions arises from time to time, and i'm very sorry that Villeneuve's Dune is not one of them. Herbert's work deserves it, but mr. Villeneuve and mr. Spaihts perverted, one by one, all the achievements established in the fantastic saga, a excruciating sacrifice in the name of artificially created mainstream acclaim and money, of course. Is this the same Villeneuve that directed Arrival, a well crafted science fiction movie? Big money says no, for the sake of profit. And surely is a sad happening, but we have seen that many times already. Another example that comes to mind is the last Avatar pastiche, as disappointing and devoid of soul as this last fiasco that i'm nailing now.I came from a different generation, times almost forgotten when going to cinema halls implicitly meant some brain gymnastics. Today, spoonfeeded audiences anxious of the last bombastic digital effect can't cope with something more complicated than passing screens on a game console. Because that's what Villeneuve and Spaihts had perpetrated. I've read an interview with mr. Villeneuve when Dune part 2 opened in my city. \"I don't like mesianic figures\", explained. That's ok, just the same as in Frank Herbert books. But, alas, mr. Herbert needed to create a messiah first in order to demolish later such a figure! But in this disgrace of a film, the director is eager to destroy him right from the start. And a neat job he does, for sure! In the interview, Villeneuve also said that dialogue is for theater and tv, not for films, and that's something one can ascertain without doubt seeing the movie: adolescent romantic drama based on pouty faces (Chani) engulfing the screen and, like a cheap tv soap opera, the insecure and fragile Paul Atreides (Chalamet) shouting at mama and crying for lost love. That's the way Paul Atreides, trained since he was a child in the art of war, self-defense, governance and a multitude of sciences, not forgetting the Prana-Bindu physical and mental control in the Bene Gesserit ways, who passed the Gom-Jabbar with flying colours, the best positioned candidate for being the Kwisatz Haderach, is portrayed in this foul perversion of a film: like a crybaby.What a nerve! Space Guild absent, the Mentat, human computers (every House has one: utterly omitted in this film) and the Butlerian Jihad never explained, the Bene Gesserit and the quest for the superhuman being merits only a few lines, the Corrino and the rest of the Houses, Bene Tleilax, the interrelation between all these galactic powers... too much material severed, the essence of the conflict is eliminated. How can anyone understand the importance of the spice in the Dune universe if what is used for is not even hinted? The spice must flow, but we don't know why.Navigators use the spice, that expands the mind, to fold the space and travel at interstellar distances without moving. That's the basis of the Empire's control over the galaxy, that's the plot device that ties all together, and that's the reason why who controls the spice, controls the Empire. Furthermore, the Navigators of the Guild float in an atmosphere made of spice gas, they need the spice to survive. And the drinking of the Water of Life in addition with the contact with the spice is the reason why Paul Muab-Dib becomes the Kwisatz Haderach:a male Bene Gesserit who have access to the memories of both his male and female ancestors as well as the capacity to bridge space and time with prescient ability. This wonder of epic sci fi, this marvel of a plot, all this and much more goes to the trash bin without any remorse. And doing so, cripples the meaning of the saga all the way.It's laughable to see what they made with any of the principal characters in order to appeal the target audiences. To name only one that irritates me the most, i'll go with Chani, Lyet-Kines's daughter. A new little detail overlooked, destroyed from the original tale, as many others. And a very important one: being the imperial ecologist daughter, Chani knows first hand the struggle in Arrakis from the very moment it starts. A strong female character. In 1965, Frank Herbert endowed the Dune female characters with a determination, power and self-confidence far ahead of it's own time and, as we see right now in the portrayal rendered by this film, ours. Chani was no exception: the love she feels for Paul is unbreakable (just as is Paul's in response), with no condition whatsoever. A cunning warrior, follower of the arrakean traditions with a great amount of wisdom, witness of every step that Paul takes to become the One. She understands perfectly the political movement that explains the marriage of Paul and Irulan, because she knows perfectly well that Paul's vision is exactly the same as her father had for Arrakis. She believes in the prophecies, but in Villeneuve's travesty is portrayed as an atheist, with no faith in his lover, believing he's not the One, and abandoning him at the end of the movie because Paul's gonna marry Irulan. The last straw: Chani jealous, and adding insult to injury, betraying the fundamental role of the Emperor's concubine as described in the novels! In what alternate universe this Chani is gonna have 3 babies from a man she despises utterly, as we can see in the last 30 minutes?Other absence that hurts so much is Alia-of-the-Knife: the Water of Life creates in Jessica's womb what we can call the ultimate Bene Gesserit, Alia Atreides. The one who inflicts the Atrteides Gom-Jabbar to his grandfather Vladimir Harkonnen, killing him and make him float to a worm's open mouth. The little, creepy and charming abomination that uses the Voice to overwhelm the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam is sorely missed, still unborn in this disaster of adaptation. Our cinema masters choose poorly once again, because in the novel Alia is 3 years old when the facts take place. Seems more suitable for them that Paul gets all the killings, and also the shouting to the Reverend Mother. To cap it all, a few minutes later in the same scene Feyd stabs Paul (?) in the most irritating fight scene never played before: a drunk's quarrel has more appeal. A skinny wounded guy with a perforated lung, panting dramatically for the sole purpose of staying alive, slays Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, the muscular Na-Baron with hundreds of knife fight training hours, a pitiful attempt in raising false stakes in the most hideous way. Even the poisoned blade in Feyd's whip (the reason why Paul can defeat him in the first novel) is omitted as well, and let's not forget that Feyd never stabs Paul. What else can be said?I will add this: i suspect one more odd event, a catastrophic rewriting for the 3rd movie. Following the pattern of cosmetic empowerment and adolescent banality á la mode showed until now, our cinematic masters will transform Chani in the real hero of the saga. The reason that leaves me to believe that future disaster\n",
            "is the artificially division invented by the filmmakers in Arrakis between the North inhabitants, mostly non-believers, and the South ones, \"fundamentalists\". This is the perfect scenario for a civil war, with Chani leading the northern \"civilized\" faction and Paul Muab-dib his southern followers. Time will tell, but let me ask you: after this disaster of a movie, what kind of denouement can we expect? A return to grace? If so, how? In three and a half years, we will see the extent of the harm. What a pity!\n",

            "Document 685 (Score: 0.0091): Having first been introduced by my dad to Arrakis via the 1984 movie, followed by my reading the books, then watching the extended TV version of the David Lynch cinema tale when it became available on DVD, and also the Sci-Fi mini series on release, I very much enjoyed the first film.The changes, though a couple of omissions were disappointing, made sense for setting up future instalments and also helped carry the story forwards in a more theatrical manner. I was therefore looking forward to seeing this film.As we approached the end of the first half of the film, and we got to see Feyd-Rautha in the arena- followed up by Lady Fenring's seduction no less, I thought to myself \"I wish my dad had been here to see this. He'd have loved it.\". And then we got the second half of the film, and I immediately took back that thought.He'd have been mad as hell!Where the first film set up better avenues for the plot to go into future book adaptations than Herbert did (he hadn't planned on there being sequels at the time), and made certain things flow better and seem more logical to the casual viewer, instead the second movie does the complete opposite. Subtle allusions to the dangers of playing with prophecy were already being wielded too heavily in the first half of this, but by the second Paul's entire character- and that of Chani too- are being changed wholesale for the sake of that heavy handed use being turned to utter sledge hammer.Meanwhile, drastic changes to the plot not only remove some of the most iconic lines in the book (eg 'Usul, we have wormsign the likes even god has never seen before', 'I remember your gom jabbar, now you remember mine', etc), but threaten to totally derail the main story beats of Dune Messiah- the next book in the series- along with important elements in later ones too.Instead of Alia being born, and surprising all present in the court by delivering Paul's message to Emperor Shaddam IV (when he comes to Arrakis after several years of disrupted spice production) despite being just a few years old, the plot is accelerated to all conclude before her birth . Instead his identity is revealed in a letter sent to Corrino.Good grief. Does no one in this universe fully understand the concept of spies? Constantly telling secrets in front of staff and servants in this film, when they made a big deal of not even having a 'pet' in the room for any such discussion in the previous one, is just a terrible movie trope. Even if every single one could be totally trusted (and they know that even Imperial Conditioning can be broken, cos they've done it), that seal on the wax of that message's cylinder would have been recognised by the courier- and most importantly the Guild workers who are required to transport him between solar systems.As for the Guild and the importance of The Spice Melange, well despite being central to the very plot of the entire book series, and theoretically this film too, their importance is conspicuously downplayed- except when it isn't of course.In the books, and the Sc-Fi channel adaptation was sensible enough to include this, Paul works out how to create a chain reaction of poison that would end spice production on Arrakis. The mere threat of doing this is enough to bring the guild, and as a result all the noble houses, in line.THIS is how the crusade spreads amongst the stars! Not a couple of million Fremen assaulting a bunch of ships and hoping to take on an entire galaxy. They'd lose. In minutes. If the main vessels didn't simply fold space away from orbit, the stolen landers would be lasered out of the sky in the same way the film showed us the taking down of spice harvesters about an hour earlier. What, did Denis forget he had that in his film?The crusade is supposed to spread by the fact that Muad'Dib ended both the imperial line and the dominance of the guild with little more than the threat of giving a command all knew his followers would obey.And speaking of that threat, in the film this is instead made with the potential use of atomics. Yet said threat is ignored by the Landsraad, and not carried out when they 'call his bluff'. The trouble is, it wasn't a bluff in the book! He challenges the navigators to look into the future, where they see him do it. Not only is this classic part lacking in the film, so is his challenge to the Bene Gesserit order: 'Look into that place where women dare not look. You will see me, staring back at you!'.Meanwhile, the death of Paul and Chani's first son at the hands of the Sardaukar is totally absent, as they have had no time to have any children at all in this overt rush to the conclusion (did Denis get the same itch Beniof and Weiss did for GoT?). This omissions would be excusable, but now they may never be parents as the film ends with Chani leaving and apparently now hating Paul. What's going on here? Is Paul now going to have the twins Leto II and Ghanima with Irulan?But that missing time elapse is important to plot and continuity. The first film established how much spice reserves Baron Harkonnen had, and as a result any disruption to the flow could be kept secret from the other houses for some time. Yet instead Villeneuve doubles down on this plot hole, by having Feyd get the spice production back on track. This doesn't happen in the books, for a reason!The first successful assault on a sietch (ie taking the Fremen on in their own home) doesn't occur until the Emperor unleashes his Sardaukar on Tabr, to which he notes to the Baron that his elite could barely best the women, the old, and the infirm, as the warriors were away at the time. Having the Harkonnen attack the northern Fremen strongholds and drive them away would have revealed just how many of them there were in the North- which is vastly more than their intelligence network believed. As stated in the first movie. If this was revealed to them, why were they not questioning their other assumptions? We can only assume it is because they have decided to suddenly make the bad guys dumb, so that the next bit of altered plot can take place.Finally we come to the action sequences of the 2nd half.Whilst they look good, they also suffer from 'the Hollywood treatment'. Paul now leads infantry running along the ground towards an enemy also running along the ground. This was literally the biggest complaint most people had about the battles from the first movie, and its an order of magnitude sillier when the Fremen have access to Sandworms, which they are riding in from one of the other flanks. Speaking of which, where the hell did they disappear to halfway through the battle?The Sardaukar are treated like The Golden Company in season 8 of GoT. They are all brought to one place, with none in reserve, and get wiped out with virtually no resistance to speak of. Off screen for the most part. Was that to save on screen time?This would literally be the daftest thing for the Emperor to do (put them all in one place that is), as fear of his elite troops is one of the ways in which he maintains his rule. All planet side somewhere they are unused to and utterly at the mercy of the Guild should they decide not to move their space ships? It would make about as much sense as the US putting every ship of every fleet in Hong Kong harbour, whilst the entire rest of the US military was deployed in HK itself, just because the president was visiting.

At all, except as a fetus who speaks to Jessica. So of course she doesn't kill the Baron. It actually works out. From a filmmaking point, good luck finding a child who could do justice to the role, even if you age her up.Jessica, in my opinion, becomes the villain after drinking the water of life. She essentially manipulates Paul into become the Mahdi. It was previously ambiguous as to her birthing a son, and by extension the Kwizatch Haderach, was due to love or vanity. This would almost now appear to be the latter. Again, just my opinion, but I don't believe the water changed her, more likely it awakened a dormant ambition.Chani is by far the most improved character from the books. With all respect to Frank Herbert, she didn't really do much. She was the love interest and ultimately the mother of the Tyrant and that pretty much sums up her relevance in the Dune Saga. She is still all that of course, but while she loves Paul, she's an outspoken cynic concerning him being a Messiah. This was a welcome change.Stilgar is exactly what he was at the end of the first book but all that throughout. I am mildly disappointed. Nevertheless, he is the most comedic character.Paul kills the Baron. Chani breaks up with him (kinda). The door is wide open for part 3.Those are the most significant changes from the book.

The conversations were choppy, the emotions were shallow, the viewer couldn't really connect to any of the character's emotions or journey. Let alone those of Paul. Me as a viewer couldn't emotionally attach to Chani & Paul's love. It was only introduced briefly here and there while we are actually being focused on Paul's emotional growth/development journey. Also, with such a heavy press tour & the background that was given to the viewer that Zendaya & Timothy are best friend in real life, it was even harder to feel their on screen chemistry.\n",

            "It has come to full fruition. Denis Villeneuve's Dune series might be the greatest sci-fi series in cinematic history. The new age of cinema has shown its potential to not just adapt in filmmaking but to show a great storyline and potentially become a classic in centuries to come. And I believe that with all of my heart. Denis Villeneuve's Dune series will be the sci-fi film that will share the throne as the greatest amongst the classics.It's a wild thing to say for a latest-release film, and I do understand the recency bias phenomenon among moviegoers. But I also believe Denis Dune will grow on people from time to time, as I felt that myself with Dune Part One rewatches and also my observation on the audiences latest reviews on Dune Part One rewatch.There are two eyewitnesses to this film: the novel non-readers and the readers. It is a bipartite review as to how they perceived this film, and I can say that I'm jealous of how non-readers might perceive this film. While I might see the words becoming a full visualization, I'm also trying to perceive how non-readers see its story.From this statement, it's due to how there are quite plenty of omissions and changes in the storyline from the novel, and the way I'm wording it doesn't indicate a bad thing, but it's a \"huh\" moment for me as I immersed myself in the story with a new perception. I believe most non-readers will see it as a linear, perfect storyline, but it's different for me, and this is not entirely a bad thing.To sum up the statement, Denis and Jon have done a tremendous job on the storyline and screenwriting, and I have to say it's the best decision yet to make the storyline go in the other direction. Most of the new scenes leave me in a great shock at how well told it is and how unexpectedly it turned out to be played, especially the ending.The words for this storyline are more fierce and cruel.Dune Part Two is an experience, not just a film of fiction. It is dramatic in its depth, poignant in its love story, profound and cruel in its motive, and epic in its style that's grandeur and maximized to near perfection.I'm blown away by how Denis managed to achieve this level of mastery in an adaptation of the greatest sci-fi novel in history. Dune Part Two is a masterpiece and beautifully adapted.It just gets better.Moving away from the main thematic entrance to this cinematic desert masterpiece. I just have to talk about the ingredients that make this film as spicy as it gets.The cinematography is top-notch and one of the most remarkable aspects of this film. The film was a whole 2 hours and 40 minutes of eye-catching experience to be immersed on a big screen. This film managed to capture lots of moments in this scene that'll make you go, \"Hell yeah, that's fire.\"The color grading for this film has its way to be most deliberate and non-subtle but will make you feel the atmospheric changes in the film, capturing the moment so well with how it is done. You'll know what I mean here...All this couldn't be done without the creative mind of Greg Frasier and perfect visualizations by Denis Villeneuve. Reading the texts and seeing how it's done in the film is one of the blessings I felt in my cinematic experience.Hans Zimmer is truly a work of art. His craft manages to consistently elevate one after the other in his film scores. The Dune Part Two soundtrack is perfectly conveyed with the instruments played and will put you in every emotion to be felt in this film.I believe Timothée Chalamet has outdone himself in this film. There are many doubts lingering about this young actor, but this film will definitely solidify them. The acting was fierce and potent enough to grip you to the edge of your seat, and I'm going to tell you to prepare for what's to come.It has always been a topic of him being overrated, but hopefully Dune Part Two will prove doubters wrong and how talented Timothée actually is. One of the greatest young actors in this new era of cinema, with a wide range of acting.Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha is exceptional casting that is once again unexpected. Like Timothée said in an interview, he has to prove himself for this film, and now it's Austin's turn, and he's actually done it. It is not an exaggeration when the word psychotic is thrown around. He truly is...Dare I say it? Feyd-Rautha is way more psychotic and villainous than he is in the novel, and you just have to witness it.I have every word to say about each actor and actress, but I couldn't prolong it. Timothée and Austin are prime examples of how well-acted this film is, and you guys have to witness others acting masterfully on the big screen.My honorable mention before ending this review is how perfectly they created the Chakobsa language.David Peterson and Denis managed to give this language depth with how dramatic the language sounds when it's spoken. It doesn't feel made up for the sake of being an incomprehensible language, but rather realistic and felt.Dune Part Two is definitely worth a watch as it's healing sci-fi and action cinema right now, and I think everyone deserves to experience this in their lifetime. Go watch it while you have the chance on the big screen!\n",

I don't want to say that, but the film is a fart in the wind instead of a thunder.Like Villeneuve's Bladerunner 2049 the optics and style are awesome, However the characters and plot give the impression of depth where is none in the end. The same disappointment when the movie comes to it's conclusion. The fact there might be a part 3 does not change that.What are the big flaws of Dune part two? Paul is shown as humble and only wants to help. He is aware of the dangers of beeing a messiah only to go full megalomania once he drinks the water of life. And the final battle is underwhelming. No real struggle to win, no clever descissions to turn the tide, no new weapons or ships to see. Other characters are even worse. - Yes the emperor is supposed to be weak, but he is so dull that it's impossible to belive he made it to such a high age in this position. - Vladimir Harkonnen was dangerous and terrifying in part one. Now he is shown to be strangely submissive when facing a joke of an emperor and his nephew who might become his successor. That doesn't fit his character at all. - Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen has to fight drugged opponents in the colosseum and a doctor, suddenly he is the big scary final boss? - The Fremen were the good guys where Paul was supposed to grow together with and fight for them to give them a better future. Now it feels like they are nothing more like some native tribe who is manipulated with witchcraft to be a tool of power for the next emperor.There are several other points, but these are the most important reasons why the pretty pictures are not enough to make this film satisfying to watch.Like John Carter of Mars.

'Dune 2' is a formidable and at times spectacular cinema. I will say I liked its predecessor's pacing better than this one whose finale seemed a bit anti-climactic and off kilter. The stylized visuals give way to a cramped and dark-lit final set that seemed like a stage play oddly a bit out of place from some earlier beautiful, and intricate set designs.. Catching this on IMAX though was certainly worthwhile though. Javier Bardem fills in for the life and energy of the movie somewhat similar to Jason Momoa in the earlier film. Easily the best scene of the movie for me was the earlier fight scene with Harkonnen harvester, ground troops and Paul and Chani in serious battle , the fight choreography and melding of visual affects and sound was absoluately stunning and 1st rate putting even the Empire Strikes Back Hoth effects to shame.

I count on many \"not useful\" after publishing what I now have in mind, but stand well in it; I don't think this movie is particularly good.Dune part 1 was, for me, a promising start (although I prefer movies to have an ending). Rarely have I been more disappointed than when I finally got to see Dune Part 2. I'll explain:The 1 was the prelude, I thought. Unlike David Lynch's 1984 Dune, director Denis Villeneuve used Part 2 to establish the story, the characters. I could then forgive that, in that film too, I thought the whole thing was slow, and partly boring. (although the Dune part 1 film was also beautifully shot). I thought that Part 2 would offer more action-oriented, exciting action than it largely does.Part 2 continues in the same vein as the first film; endless dialogues, a slow love story that never quite convinces, endless scenes (beautiful yes) of sand/desert scenery. A long period where endless time and scenes are spent on the main character's \"inner struggle\" about what he should become and do.When the film finally has some punch, the showdown between Paul Atreides and House Harkonnen and the Emperor remains incredibly tame and unexciting. One fight scene, and then it's all over.Timothée Chalamet is a shooting star and a skilled actor. But he doesn't convince me in this movie. I don't think he's suited to be a tough leader in a grand sci fi adventure like this is supposed to be. For me in this role. I actually don't think he fits this role. So this was jarring for me as well.A bunch of the best actors we have today are on the cast list. Of little help to me. The scenes with the worms are only marginally better made than in the 1984 version. Is it not possible to achieve something better with today's technology?I read that the third Dune movie is in the works. I'm not going to spend money on watching it. Maybe when it comes on a streaming service I have. Otherwise, I'm done.\n",

The film begins where the last film left off,We see Paul and his Mother Lady Jessica integrate within the culture of Fremen and just like the first film the culture and customs of the Fremen are explained seamlessly. They have their own language,their religion and prophecies,the way they value and preserve water is also explained. The cast just like the last film is phenomenal and everyone just crushes it on the screen. Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson once again carry the emotional heft of the story perfectly as Paul Atreides accepts his place as the Messiah while Lady Jessica becomes a spiritual leader to the Fremen because of her Bene Gesserit past. Javier Bardem and Zendaya get to shine as Stilgar and Chani respectively. Stilgar's belief in the prophecy and it's implications is conveyed exceptionally by Mr Bardem while Zendaya does a great job as Chani a brave fremen soldier who loves Paul but is constantly at loggerheads with the prophecy. Austin Butler as Feud Ratha stands out immensely. He is ferocious, blood thirsty and a psychotic maniac. Florence Pugh as Princess Irulan is contemplative and devoted to her father but does not have much to do in the story. The cinematography in this movie by Greg Frasier exceeds expectations and it should definitely be watched on the biggest screen possible. This film also has a lot more action than the first film and the action scenes are visceral and very entertaining to watch on the big screen. This film overall is a satisfying conclusion to the story setup in the first installment even though this film definitely sets up future installments. The score by Hans Zimmer is epic which might be an understatement but the score arouses you when Paul ascends and take his place as the Lisan-Al Ghaib.

Once again, Javier Bardem steals scene after scene with his comically touching portrayal of destiny's true believer.Despite its flaws, this film still entertains, perhaps because we're so starved for the genre that we're more forgiving than the sand worms.But truly, if you're going all-in on a mega-production such as Dune Two, give a thought to the screenplay. As theatre attendance strives for a post-COVID comeback, the redefinition of an \"epic\" film will need to include more crisp dialogue and a tighter plot line.\n",

They were not necessarily bad if you didn't read the book, like the killing of the baron, it worked, but I couldn't help but think about that. Also the child he had with Chani is not mentioned. His little sister would have been a great, twisted character but that was removed too... small things here and there that just lowered my enjoyment of the film.It is also crazy long.

If I was to go back in time I'd probably watch it at home on my tv instead of the theatre.

When we do see their faces, we can see nose, eyes and mouth and they are covered by a veil which only allows a shadow of the persons face viewable to the audience. The movie goes to great lengths to de-glamorize the physical beauty of a mature female by covering up all defining physical attributes with outer wear that is similar to Middle Eastern desert dress. The fighting scenes tend to be bloodless, in fact almost all the blood is replace with water or blue stuff. It seems this film went to the extremes to comply with the PG-13 rating. Why? The strange thing about the film is how it relates to religious fanatics and war and in the end we have a holy war. Why? Seems the whole fuss was about the blue stuff and nothing to do with religion, except for the fact that the blue stuffs home planet is populated by a very religious majority. The root cause from all the fighting is the pursuit of power and wealth that comes from controlling the blue stuff.

That movement is relentless. For me, that was a problem. Not everything was explained to my satisfaction.

With the first two Dune adaptations (one not releasing) having length issues, one being long and the other being too short, the adaptation of Dune by Denis Villenueve took a different approach by splitting the book in half. With the first coming out part one being phenomenal and a near perfect sic-fi epic with a perfect pacing. Each individual plot event feels impactful and heavy. The lack of time constraints on part 1 made the movie able to convey its story with weight, allowing for a very immersive and enjoyable experience. However, because Denis Villenueve decided to split the book in half when adapting it to the big screen, a large portion of the story was left for one singular movie. The compression of all the events in the 2nd film lead to a very fast paced movie. Dune part 2 massively suffers from this extremely fast pacing as each event that should be absolutely epic and meant to leave you in awe instead make you overwhelmed and thus makes the exciting events much less epic. The film is absolutely fantastic. As anybody who read the book knows, the book is split into 3 main parts. I believe it would've been perfect if it were to be a Dune trilogy instead. Dune part 2 is henna sci-fi epicness, but I simply cannot give it a 10/10 due to its extremely fast pacing.

It's a film that will undoubtedly provoke strong reactions, as it delves deep into the dark consequences of messianic prophecies and the destructive power of unchecked ambition.The film picks up where the first installment left off, with Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) embracing his role as the Muad'Dib. His powers grow exponentially, enabling him to manipulate sandworms, control minds, and predict the future. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and Paul's actions begin to have far-reaching and devastating consequences.The Fremen, under the leadership of Chani (Zendaya), become a formidable force under Paul's guidance, but their victory comes at a terrible cost. The holy war against the oppressive galactic empire, is unleashed, leading to unimaginable suffering and destruction.The film doesn't shy away from exploring the darker aspects of Paul's character, as his thirst for power and control grows. His relationship with Chani becomes increasingly strained as he becomes consumed by his destiny. The performances from both Chalamet and Zendaya are exceptional, capturing the complexities of their characters with nuance and depth.The supporting cast delivers strong performances, with Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen standing out as a charismatic and ruthless villain. Florence Pugh's Princess Irulan is a complex figure, caught between loyalty to her family and a growing admiration for Paul.*Dune: Part Two* is even more stunning than its predecessor. The desert planet of Arrakis is brought to life with breathtaking detail, and the large-scale battle sequences are both thrilling and horrifying. Hans Zimmer's score continues to be a highlight, providing a powerful emotional backdrop to the story.However, the film's exploration of themes such as religion, ecology, and the dangers of unchecked power may be challenging for some viewers. The ending is particularly divisive, leaving a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty that will linger long after the credits roll.*Dune: Part Two* is a bold and uncompromising film that demands to be seen and discussed. It is a sequel that expands upon the world-building of the first film while also exploring the darker implications of its story.

But the changes, fundementally change the story, characters, their motivations etc. And usually for the worse. Not to mention the plotholes it creates.I reread Dune, minutes after I read the final page, I watched both movies back to back. While rewatching the first movie, I was super hyped. I noticed small details I missed the first time. I liked the movie even more than the first time, despite some of my issues with it. E.g. No dinner party, no letter from Fenring. But for the most part it was a pretty faithful adaptation. Rewatching it, I do see the signs of the story being set up for major change in the second part. Like how they mention Shani's name as \"desert flower\" (Siyaha) and Chani says \"I hate it, it's part of the dumb prophecy\" ... Siyaha is the pet name/hypercorism that Paul uses for Chani. It's not her actual name or part of the prophecy. But when she said this, I knew it was a set up for her much expanded role in the second movie. (It comes back when Chani wakes Paul up from the water of life and everyone is like \"Lisan al-Gaib was saved by the desert flower's tears just like in the prophecy!\"Anyway, the second movie deviates far too much from the books and most of the changes aren't good.1. Fremen are religiously and ideologically divided. The North doesn't believe in the prophecy, while the east (who they keep calling \"the fundementalists\") do. So .. then why don't the tribes in the north use the water? Esp since they've tied the water into the prophecy, when it wasn't in the books. Stilgar is the leader of the Tabr Sietch, which is in the North. Stilgar is from the south. Why is everyone ok with this guy being their leader? Wouldn't youth constantly challenge him if they don't believe, which means they are just sitting on insane amounts of water for nothing. Instead Fremen refuse to listen to Stilgar and challenge him, but never to fight for leadership. In one scene you have Chani standing with a group of young women and some very American looking black bros, screaming the prophecy is fake. While Stilgar is on the other side with a group of bearded middle eastern looking dudes, yelling that Paul is the Lisan Al Gaib. It's like they're saying \"only these bearded, cis, brown people believe in this prophecy, these hip young girls and bros are too cool for school.\" P.s. I mention black people because later in the movie, they seem to all disappear. When they go south, there are suddenly no more black fremen.2. Paul doesn't get accepted into the Fremen after he fights Jamis. He doesn't take part in Jamis' water ritual. He doesn't get Jamis' stuff .. which includes his stepson, son and wife Haran. He doesn't even get his Tabr Sietch name (Usul) until much later. In fact, I absolutely DETESTED the scene where Paul and Jessica reach Tabr Sietch. Having the entire crowd, chant, yell and scream nonsensically. It really gives \"Hollywood middle east vibes,\" I'm Turkish and I cringed. They cry over Jamis, threaten Paul and Jessica etc and claim the don't accept. Stilgar accepted them. They've proven themselves infront of Fremen warriors. But as I said, Stilgar seems to have zero power. The whole point is that they don't accept people easily. But when they do, they see you as part of their group. Even the sons of Jamis are super psyched about having Usul, possibly the Lisan Al Gaib as their stepdad in the book. I did really like that they made Paul see Jamis as a friend in his prescience. But even that sours when they push Jamis as this father / mentor figure over Stilgar.3. Stilgar is a worshipper from the start. Man has barely any doubt. Stilgar in the book isn't as fanatical. He isn't sure that Paul is the one but changes as more and more signs reveal themselves and Paul gains more and more powers (like being able to predict the future and know the past). Paul laments how Stilgar, who was once his friend is now just one of his worshippers. This change never truly happens in the movie. From the very start, Stilgar, without any scepticism, is playing the role of the naive, brainwashed, ultra religious radical who sees what he wants to see. \"He said he isn't the Lisan Al-Gaib, such a Lisan Al-Gaib thing to say!\" Stilgar has to ask a council permission to allow Paul and Jessica to stay.4. Jessica immediately becomes their reverend mother, when she's barely been a Sayaddina. Nor even accepted! The ritual is completely different, the circumstances too. And we never get the fremen \"water of life, drug fuelled orgie\" (which I'm convinced is what inspired the Zion party scene in one of the matrix movies).5. The movie's time frame is messed up. In the books Paul spends 3 / 4 years with the Fremen before the end of the book. The movie does all this withing less than 9 months (Jessica is pregnant at the start, still pregnant in the end). I get why they didn't add Alia. I get how impossible it is to have a 2 / 3 year old girl run around, talk and behave like an adult. And even at one point kill people and finish off wounded sardaukar and harkonnen.6. Alia believes in the prophecy, Jessica as a result also believes in the prophecy. And she pushes Paul to accept the prophecy. To drink the water. In the book Paul choses to drink the water himself, secretly (to expand his ability to see the future). In fact Jessica would never approve or advice that in the books. In the books Jessica is worried about Paul becoming more and more of a religious figure.7. The Baron is too stoic and silent. Raban is comically angry. Feyd never tries to kill the Baron instead its the otherway around. Feyd fighting the undrugged Atreides soldier is no longer a Thufir Hawat + Feyd plan, since Thufir is completely gone from the story. Really dislike the \"Harkonen are all pale white, bald guys\" and the weird easthetic their planet has. It kinda looks goofy and empty. I get that it's geiger esque it just doesn't fit well. Like when lady Fenring goes into her room .. it resembles an alien machine chamber not a room.8. Chani tells Paul that Stilgar won't teach him how to ride worms because he's not a real fremen, but only one in name etc. She also claims all Fremen are equal (they are NOT .. sure they are equal, as in all can challenge the leader etc. But they have leaders and the leaders make the decisions)9. Chani is a Fedaykin. And women among the Fremen are all loud mouth, boyish warriors. Fedaykin in the book are a warrior cast that we first hear about when they start acting like Paul's devoted, radical body guards and personal guard/warriors. In the movie, Paul becomes a Fedaykin.10. Women among the Fremen in the books have very strict roles. Yes, they are strong, hardy women. Yes, they can and will fight. But, they seem to be completely devoted to their husbands and blindly follow their command. They don't even argue even if they want to argue. They don't talk back etc etcIn the book Chani is such a wildly different character. And I'd be ok with making Chani a bit more independent or strong willed. But Chani as the one that doesn't accept the prophecy? The leader of the anti prophecy people? Chani as the person that constantly yells the prophecy is fake? Especially considering that she's in love with Paul, and we tend to ignore all red flags while in love. Plus Paul fits every part of the prophecy and does a bunch of miraculous things. That makes no sense to me. In the books a guy comes to challenge Paul because he doesn't believe the prophecy. Chani kills him. When Paul asks her why she did that. She says \"When the other men find out that those who challenge Usul might die by the hands of Usul's women, they might think twice and avoid the possibile humiliation of being killed by a woman. Less people will challenge you as a result, my love\" (paraphrasing). Chani also treats Jessica with a high degree of respect and formality in the book. While in the movie she's constantly being rude to Jessica, to Paul, to Stilgar etc.10. The guild BARELY plays a role. The most important faction is barely even mentionned. CHAOM is barely mentioned. A lot of stuff will happen but then they'll abruptly skip over or forget about it. Like, Stilgar makes Paul do a trip on his own in the desert. But then Chani shows up to \"save him\" / help him do his \"lone trip in the desert.\" But we never get to see him do the challenge or return to Stilgar. It just cuts to a whole other scene and circumstance from there.11. Paul talks about \"the fundementalist troops\" (southern troops) and makes a distinction between them and the Fedaykin. The Fedaykin are literally Fremen Qaida. They run into death with no fear, chanting the name Muad'dib. The Fedaykin are all fundementalists in the book. Fedayin is a word used for irregular rebel bands and guerilla fighters. E.g It's pretty widely used in the Muslim world and also among some none Muslims.12. People seem a lot more stupid in the movie. They will openly talk about secret and or touchy subjects infront of everyone. E.g. Gurney for some reason thinks it's ok to loudly tell Paul that he should make use of this prophecy, use the Fremen as a tool even if he doesn't believe it etc. The only fremen that even reacts to it is Chani who is clearly upset at what she hears.13. Chani knows the prophecy is a false prophecy planted by offworlders without anyone telling her about it. She just knows.I absolutely detested the ending of the movie with everyone going on the Jihad while Chani remained on her own in the desert. I can already see that they've set Chani up to become the anti Paul rebel. I have a lot more to say, but we've reached the character limit. It was very well filmed. Well acted. But they ruined the story. I get some changes. Like removing Alia since it would be very hard to do Alia properly. But a lot of the changes are really bad and nonsensical.Book fan score 7.

I was apprehensive about Part Two, as I feared it might let me down, or become bogged down in the vast details of the novel, or be yet another victim of film-making by committee so that everything lost its colour and strangeness. That did not happen. This is a special film. It's an intelligent, beautifully made blockbuster. It's an act of devotion for the novels, too.Dune Part Two is a long, thought-provoking and ambitious film that sets out as a philosophical study of the nature of belief and religion, and manages to be that without losing any of the spectacular visual beauty and drama along the way. It isn't a particularly light or easy film, but it is stunning, and it asks you to pay attention to it fully. It's a serious film. I respect that, because it's a serious book with a serious point to make.The landscapes are striking and strange. There are thrilling and tense moments. There are also softer moments of intimacy and strong characterisation. I think Lady Jessica particularly comes across as extraordinarily dangerous, manipulative, and without any other options except to be that. Paul is the reluctant messiah who understands that nothing actually compels him to do what the prophecies say, but that at the same time, he will do what the prophecies say, because there is no other way out. His struggles are very well represented and easy to understand, without being over-simplified.What I did not like, the reason it's a 9 rather than a 10, was that a couple of moments were a little unnaturally segued into, in my opinion.

The fans will destroy the movie or hail it as the greatest adaptation of all time. These fans, that hold the books in such high regard, feel a sense of ownership, as if they are trying to tell the world \"You see, we were right. You all called us nerds or geeks but now look....\" And they will shout longer and louder until everyone else agrees.Like I said, this is a very good movie, but it is merely the middle.. (spoiler alert, there's gonna be another one!) Now unlike maybe The Dark Knight or Empire Strikes back, I don't know if this is something you would just watch randomly a few years on from now. You would have to set aside the time to make a dedicated effort to watch the whole saga. Which for me, removes it from the 'great movie' conversation.A truly great movie should be something you can watch at the drop of a hat, something you can switch on halfway through and be instantly enthralled because you've seen them so many times. I just see that with this movie. Oppenheimer was the same. A fantastic film, but are you gonna stick it on when you've got a few hours to kill, while you wait for your solicitor to get back to you with the news of how much of your pension your soon-to-be ex wife wants in the divorce settlement...? No. You're gonna grab Flight of The Navigator off of the DVD shelf or City Slickers.I digress. In a nutshell - Great visuals, incredible sound, some good performances although a missed opportunity with Butler's \"greatest movie villain of all time\". Pacing was a bit all over the place at times but overall a more than worthwhile next part to the story. I hope the next part (whether it's the final part or not) delivers too.\n",

Lynch's way maybe was a bad representation with the sounds guns and stuff (keep in mind the age and lack of tech like today).Moreover, the marginalization of Alia Atreides' role diminishes the character's significance and her intricate relationship with the overarching plot.

            "Document 521 (Score: 0.0059): I was really looking forward to Dune Part 2 in the hope that it would be better than Part One. Don't get me wrong P1 was a decent effort and set the scene reasonably well for the second instalment. Sadly, I was disappointed.Much of the criticism of the original Lynch movie stemmed from the fact that Lynch altered a few of the key aspects of the novel but the same can be said of Villeneuve's production too. I'd argue Lynch's changes are far less problematic. At least he kept Alia and the Guild Navigators and didn't consign them to footnotes. What the hell is Spaihts and Villeneuve talking about when they say the passion for Leto's death in P1 would be diminished with a time jump of a few years to P2 just so they could avoid casting a child actor in the role of Pauls sister? It makes no sense and diminishes P2 immensely.On the Guild Navigator's not appearing in the original novel; well the whole point of introducing them in the Lynch movie and the TV shows was to emphasise who had the real power in the Universe and who it was that Paul had to defeat to become the God Emperor. By leaving them out it needs some other vehicle to persuade the audience of the jeopardy faced by the Atreides dynasty and their Fremen followers. This production fails on that score.My main problem with P2, however, is the whole alteration of the time from the start of P1 to the end of P2. In the novel and the Lynch movie there was no such problem. By cramming so much into such a short period of less than a year, rather than the 2 years of the book, the whole feeling of the film becomes messy and disjointed. Maybe, it was due to the budget constraints. $190m is not a lot for a movie these days. Lynch's movie cost $40m over 40 years ago. Today, we would expect at least $250m if not $400m for such a prestigious movie, with so much expectation. Far greater than in 1984.Both P1 & P2 have been hyped up a great deal and rightly so. Audiences ought to expect a genuine epic from such great source material and with a strong history of visual productions. However, the end result was a space drama with no drama, a lack lustre soundtrack, mediocre acting, a lame script and a messy screenplay. I don't even think the costumes were all that good. No style. No panache. No drama. No humour. No intrigue.Chalamet ought to have been able to mature in his role but he wasn't given the chance. I'm not entirely convinced he could have pulled it off anyway. He looks like a young skinny teen at the end of P2 just as he did at the start of P1. The same cannot be said of Kyle MacLachlan, whose Paul Muad'dib Atreides would have had millions of Fremen warriors chasing after him across the galaxy. I couldn't see the Fremen following Chalamet into battle on Arrakis, let alone on a crusade to decimate the universe. Let's not even mention the missing characters in P2 or the unsatisfactory relationship of Paul and Chani. I never felt warm to any of the characters, which I did in both the 1984 original and the TV shows.Every omission and alteration creates problems that go beyond the basic story. It made the movie feel more like a first draft rather than the finished article. God knows how much was left on the cutting room floor but if what we ended up with is the best the editor could give us then he either deserves an Oscar or never to be hired again.No Thufir Hawat. No Count Fenring. No Guild Navigators. No child Alia. No Leto Atreides II. No Harah. There is a reason these characters exist in the novel and why leaving them out makes for a far less satisfying evening at the theatre. Will there be a Part 3? Villeneuve says it makes sense but if he's going to butcher Dune Messiah as much as he did with Dune then I'm not sure anyone should give him the budget.I gave Part One, 8/10. I give Part Two, 6/10, simply because it is worse than P1 when it should have been better.\n",

In De Villeneuve's hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about, both in relation to the hidden ways of the Fremen and the nature and mission of Paul and his mother. For example, in the second part those scenes where Paul Atreides becomes the Kwizatz Haderach are rather weak and not very convincing.Having left this essence out of the movies, they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience.

I was drawn into Villeneuve's world by the enormous scale of the design, the undeniable pull of a religious fable, the conviction of the lead players and the power of the sound and visual design.It's strange how often critics (pro or amateur) think that sound and visuals are somehow a mere adjunct to the story; that celebrity actors must all have something worthy to do (cameos are derided); that the politics of casting must be taken into account; that all old stories must have a modern take to make them relevant.Cinema IS moving pictures, and whilst sound is not a requirement, even \"silent\" era classics made good use of music and effects. Story is important, but cinema's unique power is its capacity to move an audience by engaging two of our senses in a most primeval way. Story alone cannot do this.Admittedly, one's hearing does feel at risk at times, but without the awesome sound design, Dune: Part Two would be diminished. I was emotionally overwhelmed by the power of the movie's visceral delivery. This was not some sentimental response to the tale, but a gut reaction to the physical transmission of the themes of power, corruption, revenge, faith, identity - the spiritual battle of Good and Evil. These were, for me, of greater significance than the mere political struggle between the two Houses and the Emperor., which is, in any case, subordinate to the power wielded by the Benegesserit which the Reverend Mothers themselves recognise is not supreme.However, if you want to see parallels with contemporary issues such as the problems of living in a post-imperial world, they are still very visible, and the \"romance\" between Paul and Chani is not a romance at all, burdened as it is with the visions and portents of a Messianic future.I should add that I am neither a fan of the books, having read barely 100 pages of the first, nor, as an atheist, do I adhere to any religious faith.

The first Villaneuve film of 2021 was very slow and sullen but had a certain elegance at times, if one could sit through it (I had to pause every fifteen minutes). In Part Two, however, the plot has been altered in unnecessary and absurd ways, and drama, complexity, and interest have been drained, sacrificed to three hours of CGI and cardboard acting. The good cast sound like they're sight-reading their lines. Villaneuve has been quoted as saying that he doesn't like rehearsing actors.

I was disappointed, since the technology was available, that the directoror did not incorporate the (Bene Gesserit) werding way martial art of Paul and Jessica, where the moments were so fast that it almost appeared as teleportation. This should have been in the movie, to emphasize how incredibly skilled, mysterious and god-like Paul and Jessica would be to the fremen (and the viewer).Jessica's reverend mother transformation was not explained properly and seriously underperformed by the writing. The explanation of the magnitude and significance of what Reverend Mother is was not construed properly in the movie. Reverend mothers were seriously overpowered beings with strong powers and influence. The fact that there was another hidden reverend mother on Dune was not signified properly. The transformation in the book was much more poignant and there was very little explanation to Jessica's daughter Aliah, and the Abomination. Jessica's role was seriously deminished in the second movie.Kwisatz Haderach, I found the significance and explaition and the powers were inadequately explained and explored by the movie. As mentioned earlier, the significance of powers of Reverend Mothers. But it wasn't shown how much of a big deal the Kwisatz Haderach actually was and how much more powerful he was. His precience, past memories should have been more visually and nuanced.It felt like the director was too cautious or afraid to explore the more mysterious and transcedental parts of the story, which in my opinion are the core of the story. Without it feels almost pointless and like a different plot, where Paul just fights to free the Fremen and Jessica gets a nun spiritual job with the Fremen. While Paul is shown as a gifted fighter with some sort of special abilities, that don't look all that different to anyone else. Where in fact Paul's fighting when using weirding way would almost be incompreheble to the Fremen.In summary, the movie is a visual feast with a theatrical presence of a masterpiece, but fails capture the magnitude of the main characters and their abilities and in essence what the power struggle (not just for spice) is all about.

Once again the technical aspect of the production is phenomenal: everything is very well crafted (direction, cinematography, production design, performances, score) and it is undoubtedly a big part of the film which has to be recognized and that it saves it for me. This is because the narrative part has a lot of issues. If the first movie was still slow paced, it was able to create an imaginary and become iconic, it had the purpose of setting up the second part and I thought some sort of payoff was coming in \"part two\". Instead even the second movie is all setup with a final battle which lasts like 15 minutes and a very rushed and anticlimactic finale. But if the first part took more its time to better justify the characters' actions, this second part doesn't do that (maybe more screen time would have beneficial). Many times characters do things out of nowhere or because the story needs them but their actions doesn't feel earned and justified in most cases. I'm not saying it's all bad and I liked the movie (the rating shows that) but it could have been so much more.The other issue is that this part two in the end is essentially part one but three years later, it has all the same merits and defects. It is technically exceptional and it is surely able to impress and foment. On the flip side they both were not able to make the viewer empathize much with the characters and the worst thing of all: it is once again truncated. I accepted it for the first one because it was a build up and because it was the first part of the book, but here it's bad. I get that there is a sequel coming (in theory) but the story is interrupted once again. I've read comparisons to \"Empire Strikes Back\" because it was the middle part of a trilogy, but the plot of that movie was closed. Indeed the last shot of \"Episode V\" is a clear indication of the closure of the story narrated but opening to the fact that \"something is more to come, the final battle is nearing\". \"Dune: part two\" is instead cut anticlimactically.Unfortunately I'm pretty disappointed by \"Dune: part two\" which was the movie I was expecting the most this year. I liked it but I felt a lot of wasted potential. It could have been something truly epic and for the ages, instead it has major issues that reduce the impact of the movie itself.\n",

In this second part, Paul (Timothee Chalamet) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), exposed by the Harkonnen after devastatingly losing their family... join forces with Chani (Zendaya) and the Fremen, the local people of Arrakis long before The Harkonnen first arrived. Paul sets on a Journey to learn the ways of the desert, while Lord Rabban has full authoritarian control of Arrakis to boost the production of spice to its full capacity in order to gain full control of the planet. After Paul passes the most important lesson in the Fremen Training taught by Stilgar (Javier Bardem), he ascends Paul, and becomes Lisan Al-Gaib, the leader of their people with the duty of proving that he is the Fremen's last hope of taking back Arrakis and freeing the Fremen from battling with the Harkonnen.

But then, the Fremen, along with Paul and Gurney's help, roll the dice and take on the Emperor and the Harkonnen, after The Emperor was found responsible for the death of Duke Leto Atreides, he finds himself exposed and recently made more vulnerable. The Fremen; recently successful in the battle for their freedom against the Harkonnen, cheer up.

With so many people believing different things, and so many religions in the world, it can be hard to make a movie around this topic. It is not impossible however, since other shows have done it, such as His Dark Materials, Lucifer, and Dune. Dune Part One and Two is directed by Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya from Spiderman the Homecoming Trilogy.Paul Atreides (Chalamet) is now with the Fremen people, trying to fulfill the prophecy. Paul also wants revenge on Baron Harkonnen, who killed his father. Meanwhile, the Harkonnens want to take over the desert (Arrakis) from the Fremen.Dune Part Two is a movie with lots of action, people riding cool creatures, and has incredible acting. What makes this movie so compelling is the religious aspect. Chalamet is compelling when portraying Paul, someone who at first did not believe the prophecy, but soon learns his purpose in life. From part one he grows into a good fighter, and someone who people wanted to follow. Zendaya portrays Chani, one of the Fremen people. By the end, I felt bad for her since she was alone. However, she stuck to her beliefs, even when everyone else decided to go in a different direction. Zendaya does an excellent job at playing someone that does not believe in the prophecy but cares about Paul. I enjoy seeing Zendaya expand her horizons, going from a love interest in a superhero movie, to a love interest and a strong warrior in a drama. Rebecca Ferguson played Paul's mother (Lady Jessica), who was the first one who wanted her son to fulfill the prophecy. She is a part of the Bene Gesserit (a religious sisterhood). Her main goal is to train her son to become who she thinks he will be. Austin Butler is the nephew of the guy in charge of house Harkonnen. Feyd-Rautha likes to kill people for fun and is a good fighter. The relationship between the two houses (Atreides and Harkonnens) is complicated, which makes the audience want to know what is going to happen.Unfortunately, no one taught me anything about religion when I was younger. My first Introduction to it was watching the show Lucifer (which I think is sad). This is why I think making movies with religious meaning behind them is a wonderful thing to do. I have had a hard year (with death and sickness in my family), and religion has somehow become a topic I like to discuss.

What I appreciated about the first film carries over seamlessly into the sequel. Despite being a sci-fi movie, it doesn't feel like one; even without the sci-fi action and special effects, it remains a compelling, immersive, and grounded storytelling experience. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 odd minutes, the movie flies by, with not a single wasted moment. The narrative flows effortlessly, maintaining organized chaos and hitting all the necessary beats along the way. Given that it's a sequel, you might expect a drop-off, but that's simply not the case. Every actor on screen, from Timothy and Zendaya to Josh Brolin and Austin Butler, along with the other talented individuals, delivered exceptional performances. Each of them was on point and effectively brought the story to life. Another standout aspect is Hans Zimmer's score. Each note propels the narrative with intent, effectively enhancing the atmosphere of every scene. Zimmer's mastery is evident in his ability to employ the same theme across various emotional contexts. While we've heard the theme repeatedly, this film allows us to experience it in different emotional nuances, depending on the on-screen events. While it's still early in 2024, this film should definitely be considered an Oscar contender next year. Dune part 2 effectively concludes the first of six books in the expansive Dune saga. Part of me is eager to see the next installment on screen, but if this marks the end, I'm good with that too, considering the saga gets a little weird from here.

However, the crushing sense of scale is so important for the feeling you get from this (and the previous entry) that I really can't imagine the same effect from watching it on your phone or something. So, do see it on the largest, loudest screen you can find.With that out of the way let's get to the film proper. At nearly 3 hours long, I could have easily sat on my chair for double that time and still not be bored. The second instalment of Dune is a miracle in several ways, a miracle of special effects, set and costume design and of storytelling, that manages to make a famously unwieldy story perfectly easy to parse, but it is above all a miracle of pacing. There isn't a second of boredom or a low point in the movie, it's an epic in the true sense of the term, you spend half the time crushed by scale and the other half lost in the details of the movie.Managing to tell a complex political tale with a surprisingly small amount of dialogue or exposition, the film also makes several very smart changes to the book which I really want to see pay off in the third movie (there will be one, as this ends in a cliffhanger). In terms of acting everyone is pretty good, but the addition of Austin Butler as the psychotic Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen is the real standout here. Florence Pugh is promising but has a limited role, which if this is anything like the books will be greatly extended in the third movie. A real masterpiece.\n",

            "Document 612 (Score: 0.0046): \"Dune: Part Two\" is the much-anticipated sequel to the 2021 film \"Dune,\" both based on the seminal science fiction novel by Frank Herbert. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the film continues the story of Paul Atreides as he navigates the treacherous politics and conflicts of the desert planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. With stunning visuals, a compelling narrative, and a stellar cast, \"Dune: Part Two\" promises to be an immersive cinematic experience that delves deeper into the richly imagined universe of the source material.Set in a distant future where humanity has spread across the galaxy and formed a feudal society, \"Dune: Part Two\" explores themes of politics, religion, ecology, and the human condition. At the center of the story is Paul Atreides, played by Timothée Chalamet, a young nobleman whose family assumes control of Arrakis, the only known source of the valuable spice melange. The spice is essential for space travel, making it the most valuable substance in the universe and the focus of intense political intrigue.In \"Dune: Part One,\" we saw Paul's family, House Atreides, betrayed by their rivals, House Harkonnen, leading to their downfall and Paul's journey into the desert, where he discovers his destiny as a prophesied messiah figure, the Kwisatz Haderach. The film ended with Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson), joining forces with the native people of Arrakis, the Fremen, as they prepare to take back control of the planet.\"Dune: Part Two\" picks up where the first film left off, with Paul and the Fremen launching a guerilla war against the Harkonnens and their imperial allies, the corrupt Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. As Paul embraces his role as the Kwisatz Haderach and gains the trust of the Fremen, he must also contend with the visions of the future that come with his newfound powers. These visions, which are both a blessing and a curse, show him possible futures where he becomes a savior or a tyrant, leading to internal conflict as he struggles to determine the right path.One of the central themes of \"Dune: Part Two\" is the idea of destiny versus free will. Paul's journey is guided by prophecies and ancient traditions, but he also has the ability to shape his own fate. This internal conflict is reflected in the larger political struggle for control of Arrakis, as various factions vie for power and influence, each believing they are following the path laid out for them by fate.The film also delves deeper into the ecology of Arrakis and the role of the spice melange in shaping the planet's ecosystem. The spice is produced by giant sandworms that inhabit the deserts of Arrakis, and its extraction has had a profound impact on the planet's environment. The Fremen, who have adapted to life in the harsh desert, have a deep respect for the planet and its fragile ecosystem, seeing themselves as stewards rather than exploiters.Visually, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a feast for the eyes, with stunning landscapes, intricate costumes, and cutting-edge special effects bringing Herbert's vision of Arrakis to life. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, adds to the epic feel of the story, with sweeping orchestral themes that underscore the drama and emotion of the narrative.In addition to Chalamet and Ferguson, \"Dune: Part Two\" features a talented ensemble cast, including Zendaya as Chani, a Fremen warrior and Paul's love interest; Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto Atreides, Paul's father; and Javier Bardem as Stilgar, the leader of the Fremen tribe that takes Paul in. Each actor brings depth and nuance to their role, helping to flesh out the complex characters that inhabit Herbert's universe.Overall, \"Dune: Part Two\" is a worthy continuation of the story begun in the first film, expanding upon the themes and ideas introduced in \"Dune\" while setting the stage for an epic conclusion. With its compelling narrative, stunning visuals, and talented cast, the film is sure to captivate audiences and further cement Villeneuve's reputation as one of the premier directors working in science fiction today.\n",

Expect a whole lot of variations on the words \"epic\" and \"spectacle\" too. Whatever big words you apply to the result, Villeneuve undeniably did not approach Frank Herbert's beloved sci-fi novel with modest aspirations. It's his ambition, along with the top tier of behind-the-scenes craftspeople with whom he collaborated, that have paid off in this superior follow-up to the Oscar-winning 2021 film.While the first installment often felt like half a film, Dune: Part Two locates significantly higher stakes on Arrakis, while injecting just enough humor and nuanced themes about power and fanaticism to flavor the old-fashioned storytelling. More than a simple savior or chosen one story, Dune: Part Two is a robust piece of filmmaking, a reminder that this kind of broad-scale blockbuster can be done with artistry and flair.The movie picks up so closely on the heels of the first film that the Fremen are still transporting the body of Jamis (played by Babs Olusanmokun) home after he was bested in the fight with Paul Atreides (portrayed by Timothee Chalamet). After the massacre of House Atreides, Paul chose to go with the Fremen, much to the consternation of his mother Jessica (played by Rebecca Ferguson). Thinking both Paul and Jessica were taken by the desert and all hopped up on violence after destroying the Atreides interlopers, House Harkonnen amplifies its attack on the Fremen, leading to a few remarkably staged battles between the warriors and soldiers.Villeneuve and his team deftly fill the first hour with battle sequences that counter the firepower of the Harkonnen military and the Fremen tribal combatants, who often literally emerge from the earth to destroy them. Bodies fall from the sky as enormous ships burst into flames in a way that feels nearly operatic. Amidst the chaos, Dave Bautista cannily sketches Rabban Harkonnen as a wartime leader who is in way over his bald head, while Stellan Skarsgård leans even harder into a sort of blend between Nosferatu and Jabba the Hutt.As the battle between the Fremen and the Harkonnens for control of Arrakis serves as the backdrop for Dune: Part Two, Paul's arc from nervous young man at the beginning of the first film to potential leader plays out in the foreground. A Fremen tribal leader named Stilgar (portrayed by Javier Bardem) is convinced that Paul Atreides is the chosen one foretold among his people for generations. Even as so much of the mythology points to Paul's savior role, the Emo King tries to blend into the Fremen, forming a relationship with a young warrior named Chani (played by Zendaya). Paul passes the tests put in front of him by the Fremen, takes on the tribal name of Muad'Dib, and vows vengeance against the Harkonnens who were behind his father's death1.Dune: Part Two is not just a sequel; it is a testament to the power of visionary filmmaking. Denis Villeneuve has crafted a work that is epic in scale, yet deeply personal. This film solidifies Dune as a landmark in science fiction cinema, offering a narrative experience that is as intellectually engaging as it is emotionally resonant.As the credits roll, I sit there, spellbound. Dune: Part Two isn't just a movie; it's an experience. It reminds us that power corrupts, that legends are forged in sacrifice, and that love can bloom even in the harshest of landscapes. Villeneuve's direction, combined with breathtaking cinematography and stellar performances, elevates this film beyond mere entertainment.And so, dear reader, I leave you with this: Let the spice flow, let the sandstorms rage, and may your dreams be haunted by sandworms and whispered prophecies. 🌟🌵\n",

But at its core, the movie is about motherhood and the lengths to which a mother will go to protect and uplift her child.Littered with lingering landscape shots of Arakkis, the movie pays respect to the planet that gives both the Fremen and the galaxy life, its most valuable resource being spice. But much like a planet raises and nurtures people, giving them the space and protection to grow and learn for themselves while also guiding them with and through challenges-sandstorms and scalding hot days-Paul's mother, Lady Jessica (now Reverend Mother) guides Paul's life, shaping the path she set when she first decided to have a son rather than a daughter.And as much as the power of belief has the potential to corrupt Paul, causing countless deaths across the galaxy, the unconditional love of Jessica for Paul is itself a use of power, a transference of opportunity and protection that confers advantages onto its recipient. Jessica, so confident that her son is the Kwisatz Hadarach, she used the myths that the Bene Gessirit planted in Arrakis to propel Paul into leadership of the Fremen-a substantial feat given that both she and Paul are off-worlders and relatively new to Fremen society. In addition, in both the first and second films, Jessica physically protects Paul while simultaneously training him, using those moments to instruct Paul on how to better himself. Ultimately, it is this belief in her son, training in her ways, and protection as he reaches his potential that allows Paul best Feyd-Rautha and usurp the throne.Spice may be the most valuable substance in the galaxy, but belief is the most powerful source in the Dune universe. But more than a struggling population's belief in a savior, the belief of a parent in their child has truly transformational consequences. In that way, Paul may be the dagger of change, plunged directly into the heart of the Imperium, but Jessica is the knife wielder, living up to her role as a Bene Gessirit, controlling everything from behind the scenes. And it is that same power that she will grant to her unborn daughter when the story continues.\n",

However, past the few elements that makes watching the movie not a complete waste of time, but not something you're really satisfied with, glaring weaknesses remain.It's too often over-dramatic. It makes copious use of the same boring and easy techniques to create superficial drama: the zoom-in on characters, taking an embarrassing heroic pose or looking deeply intense with determined eyes and a slight frown.Oh, and the shouting! Characters and crowd shouting ad nauseam the same mantras as if to make us, simpletons, understand basic concepts by repeating them three, four, five times. We got it. Move on! Done and seen a thousand times elsewhere.On that subject, this movie is very loud. In every sense of the word. Sometimes the actors shout for no apparent reason other than to convey to the public that they're saying something important. Thing is, it actually has the opposite effect. It's like a child throwing a tantrum, demanding to be heard. Then, there's the action scenes. Oh my, did they overdo them. It's constant blasting and fighting. The fast food of the movie industry. The louder the better. Explosions, fast camera movements, noise all around as if the void of the script needed to be filled at all time with visual stunts so that you don't have to think too hard about the story.It follows that the dialogues are weak, really weak. If one isolated the words and read them they'd be appalled by the sheer stupidity and shallowness of some of the lines. And obviously, it would look completely ridiculous compared to the book.All in all, this is just a mass market product that has some moments but that is plagued by the necessity to appeal to everyone and places the bar for that everyone very low. It does not expect much from itself or from its audience and so you leave the theater wondering what was the point.\n",

Greg Frasier's breathtaking cinematography continues to reach new heights.It takes tremendous artistry and effort to find depth and shadow in a perpetually flat and bland desert. I tried to photograph a desert on holiday recently. It's bloody difficult.The spice, presented as fine sparkling orange grain sprinkled in sand, is sumptuous and addictive to look at.

The central theme of being a messiah for the support of the masses for personal gain without true faith in the cause is richly fascinating.And yet, Dune: Part Two is a less engaging experience.Part Two uses the pacing of a commercial blockbuster to cover a bigger chunk of its ambitious story. Having rewatched the first Dune an hour before seeing the second, the pacing was jarring.What's gone is the lingering mood from the first Dune, where the shots were held a bit too long and slowly immersed the audience into its world. There was a metaphysical quality to Paul's contradictory visions that was compelling. The mood was delivering all the emotions.Now, these wistful moments are shortened and traded for plot points. It is delivered like summarized information.I'm aware I'm in the minority and the stylistic transition worked for most people, which is great.

I'm writing this review somewhat for myself because years later, when I read it again, I want to see how much I elevated this legend and how it managed to close so many things correctly despite its mini flaws.For the past two days, the film hasn't left my mind, and the reason I give it a perfect 10 is this. Whenever I talk about the film, I get excited because I've seen a visual masterpiece. It has incredible cinematography, beyond amazing. Watching the Lisan al Gaib scene where the Fremen walk from a bird's eye view, the scene between Paul and Feyd at the end, the scene where the Fremen accept Paul, the Harkonnen attack in the opening sequence, and many others, you feel that there are very few scenes like these. Greig Fraser is a master at this. Besides that, Hans Zimmer's music, which doesn't mean much when listened to alone but reaches a tremendous dimension with the sound mixing, adds a whole new dimension to the film. It's truly wonderfully designed and fitted, Denis, you're amazing.And the casting is phenomenal. Dave, Timothée, Florence, Zendaya, Rebecca, Javier, Josh, Austin, they're all fantastic. I won't describe each one separately, saying 'this scene was superb,' everyone fits their role so well and performs so excellently that the film becomes a recital; there isn't a single scene with amateurish or shallow acting. Besides acting, something that needs to be mentioned is the stunts. The fight choreography was quite good and clear, especially the scene between Feyd and Paul at the end, where the music stops and we watch pure fighting for a few minutes, it was wonderful.Besides the cinematography, casting and harmony, the legendary use and synchronization of music, there are two more reasons why this film excels and why I rate it highly. Firstly, the film is superbly adapted, I won't touch upon this further. Secondly, it's a fantastic critique film.The film critiques every mundane and inherent aspect of human nature. Whether it's the dynastic system, coercion around the secret gene preservation logic, the exploitation of religion, political chaos, inefficient use of resources, and many more points, it hits the bullseye so accurately that it's both overwhelming and not tiring while making you feel it, a tremendous achievement.Now, onto the contentious topic of staying faithful to the books and the polemic of how similar it was... Despite everything, it's said that both Part 1 and Part 2 were quite faithful to the book, and I believe they were. Some details might have been skipped or not exactly replicated in the second film, but for such a meta and philosophical book series, this is extremely normal; if everything were portrayed exactly, it might have been incomprehensible. I won't comment on the film's dynasty and operation right now because as a sequel, it has to complete the script with good motivation and also convey the characters it portrays well; I'm very happy it achieved this.The film had a fitting humor, some scenes were mildly funny and unintentionally successful, which was admirable. Also, I think it will sweep the awards at the Oscars next year; it could win for its amazing costumes, production design, adapted screenplay, and maybe even best picture.It's the peak of cinema that I've ever seen; go to IMAX, you won't regret it. I didn't delve into the details because everyone should watch it for themselves and try to interpret it in their own way; it's that kind of film.\"May thy knife chip & shatter.\" March 2024.\n",

Villeneuve managed to capture and create his own totality of the world of Dune.

Just because people have stopped going to the movie theatres? Well, as we see with this movie which has already broken many box office records, people haven't necessarily stopped going to the cinema, they just don't wanna waste money on bad movies. So the Hollywood crisis is, sure, partly due to technological change, but also to a severe lack of good stories to tell. And funnily enough, the lack of stories to tell in 2024 has a parallel to the story of Dune 2, mainly in that the prophet of Paul Atreides is precisly the story the Fremen need to reach beyond the dunes and out into the galaxy, we need a similar story to reach beyond ourselves today too.

A significant issue is the lack of a recap of the first film at the start, which leaves viewers who haven't recently watched Dune 1 at a disadvantage.Many book adaptations stray too far from the novel, but Dune 2 appears to have the opposite problem. It seems to follow the novel so closely at times that it fails as a movie. The film feels episodic and lacks a coherent rhythm or pace. Hardcore sci-fi enthusiasts might love it, but for the average \"generalist\" movie watcher, it's a hard slog.From a narrative perspective, the film is overly dark and lacks the lighter moments that bring contrast to a story. This results in a plot that feels flat and one-dimensional. Overall, Dune 2 might satisfy die-hard fans of the series, but it falls short for those seeking a more balanced and engaging cinematic experience.\n",

Though, having grown up on a steady diet of Lynch's version, I do find myself always comparing this film with that one (I have read the book, but it was ages ago). It also means that I'm pretty familiar with the story.The problem is that there were a number of divergences from the book. For instance, it appears that the time that the events take place have been compressed from three years to one, which means that Alia isn't born (which also means that she doesn't kill the Baron either). Then there is the whole thing about there being two factions, one that is secular and one that is fanatical, and it turns out that Chani is from the secular one, which leads to an interesting ending.Then again, I suspect that the creators assume that most of the audience don't actually know the story. Like, I'm only familiar with it up to the end of the first book, but the film did end on a cliff-hanger, suggesting that there is more to come (something that didn't seem to be the case with the Lynch version - though there is another version that also includes Dune Messiah and Children of Dune).As I mentioned, it was a pretty good film, especially the cinematography - that was amazing. However, my main gripe would be that it felt as if the film ended a bit too quickly, which I have to say is odd for a film that happens to be two and a half hours long. Actually, that was even more strange considering that the battle in the first film seemed to take up half of the film, so I was expecting that the battle here would take about as much time, though it didn't.

He calls a worm and it breaks through the hill that he was standing on continuing to the right, seemingly out of eye to the fremen since the hill was blocking there view of the right...yet somehow they appear to see him riding this worm and cheer.Then they attack a spice harvester, hidden under the sand, seemingly able to hide their digging, footprints but hey ok. Then they attack just as they are able to get run over, an ornicopter takes out seemingly 1/2 of them, then Paul and Chani decide to attack it, while some others go to confront other soldiers. The ornicopter stays on Paul/Chani and can't seem to just move around so it can see under the legs and lets itself be blown up, all ground combat seemingly done with swords/knives for some reason. Next attack on a harvester is completed with only a single laser weapon....why have 1/2 the men killed in the first raid if you had that!So many more scenes that just abruptly happen or people teleporting around for no logical reason. Paul comes into the temple to take the water of life, \"You shouldn't be here\", \"I'm here to take the water of life\", teleport to him with different clothes, \"here you go\". Pretty sure when he takes it he had other people with him and it wasn't done so damn quickly.Alia being a fetus throughout the entire movie made zero sense given they showed what appeared to be her quickened growth in the beginning after the water of life was taken, months and months go by in the desert(Chani telling Paul it's been a long time since he's had his nightmares implies their relationship has been going on a long time) yet Jessica never appears to show further than maybe 6-7 months along...Alia never being born and not killing the Baron.

We basically get a North vs South for believers and non-believers but no continuation of the mythology around which they believe. We basically get one scene to explain the ineptitude of the current ruler of the planet and some even less informative scenes to reveal our new villain. No politicking of why the Emperor did what he did other than Paul's dad was weak in the Emperor's eyes. We get no understanding into the strategy of either army outside a 30 second scene that is basically to explain to us because it's mostly just going to be sand when the main fight happens. Why are the Harkonnens so stupid after being led to believe they were clever and scheming in the first movie?It felt like the director had a list of scenes he wanted in the movie and didn't really care how he got between them or if people understood why things were happening?

With the exception of a scene on the Harkonnen planet, Giedi Prime, which is rather impressive in martial white and black tones. That said, I still miss David Lynch's crazy and disgusting Harkonnen with their strange greenish/industrial planet and sexual perversions.Here we are in a demonstration of pure force, strangely contradicted by the ridiculous fear suddenly displayed by Rabban, and by an astonishing vulnerability of the Harkonnen troops like the Sardaukars to the guerrilla techniques of the Fremens without this being convincingly justified by the mise-en-scene.We can only imagine that what makes the difference is the infinitely superior number of the Fremen, greatly underestimated by the Harkonnen, which allows them to gain the upper hand at the cost of a major human sacrifice.

But it was long, man. But it was good. But it was long. I don't know what my final decision is because you know, it was good. But it was long...I caught someone sitting in front of me checking the time as the film slowly slogged on. Performances were solid all around. The story is well worn. The photography was, well, iconic. But it seemed a little too much on the extreme close ups of faces. My god, the lensing was so tight that in one shot the character's eyes were in focus but his nose was out of focus. On Imax, we can inspect every pore on his skin.Overall, there was something more exciting about part one, as we are introduced to the setup. Am intriguing world shot in a iconic way. Engaging characters in energetic scenes. I saw the first part twice in the theatre. I have the DVD at home and have watched it again since. I am not so excited about revisiting part two. I guess it's a kind of phenomena like the Matrix. The first film was very appealing because of it's well crafted fantasy world that was exciting to learn about. But by the second movie, it was already kind of been there, done that. I sort of had the same reaction with The Dark Knight Rises after enjoying the bombastic Dark Knight.Dune as a story is so popular, George Lucas used it as one of his sources for Star Wars. The chosen one template is very familiar, and it takes larger-than-life filmmaking to make it something that stands out. This comes in the form of the depiction of a desert world that has gargantuan flying machines. The domiciles in this world are simple but elegant. The costumes are evocative of ancient religions. The music fit as well as it did in part one.Appropriately, the second movie is simply titled Part Two. For it is more of the same. So the second outing there is less awe to some degree, and more drama, with shots of very very large heads. I'm not knocking this film in any way. I think perhaps my own short attention span is at fault. As an editor, I wouldn't dare question the wisdom of the people who put this together. It is a service to all fans of this classic story to tell it right. Perhaps if I was the director, I would pick up the pacing of the dialogue just a wee little bit. But I'm sure it wouldn't work as well.In conclusion, the movie has many good scenes of grandeur, but has more scenes of big faces. Sure, great care was taken to hire some of the most attractive faces available, so that helps. I guess I enjoy rollicking adventures more than slightly sedate adventures like this one. Maybe time will change my attitude about Part Two compared to Part One. But for now I will give it a 7 out of 10.\n",

This truly felt like you actually need to watch Dune Part One again and relearn stuff. AND, I hated that this film was written to be more of an actual 2hr 45min interlude to the third film. It was not a film that can stand on its own EVEN with the knowledge you had if you watched the first part.I also felt that this came off intensely slow (not well paced) and overlong. The action would only peak for 10 mins towards the end AND its barely a climax in fact. A lot of the characters in this film are fodder (ie Butler and Pugh) and could have been edited out of it, and it would still make sense. Butler is definitely overhyped for how little/barebone his role is. Zendaya and Chalamet took the biggest chunk of the film but still felt underwritten - that's a testament given how long the film feels. The religious cult storyline faired better but I felt that it could have been more subtle and organically ingrained into the story rather than driven into dialogue.Overall, just not my cup of tea.

Just because there is so much dialogue and actually not that much of visually impressive scenes which would work better on IMAX.Feels like they used the time in less important places. Sardukan are suddenly poor cannon fodder instead of empires finest fighters. Paul and his savvy mates taking suddenly harvesters with gadgets they just suddenly happen to have. Nothing is explained via moving pictures. Not anything like how they organize the strikes against Harkonen or how they happen to have weapons of different variety and so on. Things just happen. Suddenly just because it's conventional Paul walks to different places without virtually any kind of resistance or drama just so that he can convey some lines which should be meaningful for the viewer. As it was in the first part, they don't really show the view of Harkonens. I liked the dynamic between the Harkonen baron and Rabban in the first movie, even though that they did gave very little of time for that side of the story in the first part, but they give even less time in this movie.I expected at least something to really stand out in a production of this scale but nothing really stands out.

It felt like each scene gives you the bare minimum to understand what's happening, but elaborates on nothing. It felt like it wants you to immerse yourself in a unique and complex world, but gives every setting only a few minutes of time before hopping straight to the next. For example, the training of Paul. We never see him learn how to ride the sandworm, so when he succeeds, it doesn't feel as triumphant as it would have otherwise. The Harkonnens are also much less intimidating than they were before. Most of their screentime is comprised of them trying and failing to farm spice on Arrakis, until they are defeated by Paul and the Fremen at the end without much difficulty. They should have put up more of a fight. Lastly, I know from sources that an ecological message the was very important in the book was emmited completely from the film. The Fremen speak of bringing green back to Arrakis, but that's all we ever see them do.Part of it may be a limitation of the format. If one must adapt a book full of complex lore, than either a trilogy or even a serialization may be the better option as you get more time to explain everything. I know that a third film is coming but it's not based on the same book anymore, and while I haven't read any of the books, I don't believe I should.

From cinematography to music to choreography to acting and dialogue, this movie had a mountain to climb to prove itself, and it did.With Hans Zimmer composing the score, it should surprise no one how well it compliments the film. Greig Fraser (Dune - Part One, The Creator, The Batman) was at the helm of cinematography, and really took my breath away with the magnificent vistas, incredible use of colours and even infrared, and expert capture of motion and scale. Fraser explains that they shot in digital, transposed to 35mm, then back to digital. This seemed absurd to me, until he explained that digital appeared too crisp for audiences, and film too nostalgic. His method obtained the perfect balance. I can't fault him for that, because I agree.The real risk here is of course the adaptation. How to retain some of the richest and most beloved science fiction lore in existence and condense it into the 2 hours and 46 minutes runtime. Villeneuve took a huge risk by splitting the first book into two parts. Had studios not green-lit part two, we would have been left with half a book. Unsatisfying for everyone. Thankfully the gamble paid off, and he was able to tell the epic story across two movies bordering on three hours. Even this required a brisk pace, with many notable scenes omitted. Despite this, I think Villeneuve retained the heart and soul of the story. He created two movies which appeal to both general audiences, and fans alike.

It diverges from the book, which is fine to do with purpose but that's sorely missing here. What purpose was there in that duel if the great houses didn't care one bit for it?The movie went out of its way to make the Fremen seem a lot more frenzied and fanatic than they were in the books - to the detriment of their humanity and strategic use. A bunch of Fremen commandeering space-travelling vessels to carry their Jihad into space was as unbelievable as it was nonsensical due to their strong ties to the desert. They weren't ferried unto other planets to wage war as much as to deal with the overhead armada - why would they be capable of doing that, even with stolen ships?One of the key takeaways from the book was the author's insights into the ecology of the planet - which is absent from both movies, although touched upon briefly - that goes directly with the reasoning behind the final scene and threat: Fremen don't need the spice but the entire galaxy does; the Fremen's ultimate goal directly involves affecting spice's continued existence.This movie does none of the above and chooses to lean heavily into Paul being the less-keen-but-forced-at-the-slightest-provocation leader of a genocidal cult whose only narrative purpose is to genocide the galaxy - as it is said over and over again.If you know current day politics, you recognize the political undertones even more-so than the day the book was written: the West are the Great Houses, Paul is the hebrew Messiah leading the unwashed and dull-witted hordes into cleaning the world of the oppressors.An insult to the book.\n",

The cinematography of the movie was great, but splitting the Fremen like how Islam is split was a poor choice. The choice to make the Fremen of two sects might have been a good way to go given how religious sects go, but in MY opinion it was the wrong way to go. And making Paul and even more reluctant hero also weakened the movie.

Like in the beginning they raid a harvester which has support legs, even though it runs on tracks... they put a lot of effort into hiding behind those legs and then shot down a fighter, after that they destroy the harvester with powerful lasers. Before and after that scene all harvester do not have these legs. Also on the following raid, they can kill the harvester with lasers even while multiple fighters fly around. Why did they not shoot down the fighters with the lasers first? Why those lasers never been used before by anybody, not even in the fight sword vs sword, nobody is using lasers except the desert people? Then the means of transport is riding a worm? Why does the worm stay on the surface, why it doesn't dive. They said if worms meet they fight to the death, yet they can ride 4-5 worms parallel and they seem to get along. Then at one scene he drinks the water of life and suddenly everybody else is there. Wasn't he just in the north and said he can't go south, whereas everybody else went south? How was he there first and how did everybody else show up after he drank? Why did he not drink after his mother had a sip? Why the old mother said they made a mistake when she realized the pregnancy?

The profound impact of Frank Herbert's epic 1965 science fiction masterpiece on both literature and religion is not to be overshadowed by Denis Villeneuve's visionary homage. This is the book come to life, and if you appreciate the book, the movie should resonate deeply with you.I struggle to think of a better-executed sequel; though 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'The Dark Knight' are certainly in the running, 'Dune Part Two' excels beyond both. Its strength lies in the combination of jaw-dropping world-building, extraordinary acting, and a script that allows the audio-visual experience to unfold effortlessly. 'Dune' is a spiritual journey deeply rooted in Muslim culture and Western Colonialism's quest for natural resources, which is even more relevant today as it was nearly 50 years ago when the book was written (i.e., \"The Spice,\" which always equated to oil in my mind).Aesthetically, the film has no equal, which is no surprise considering the director's extraordinary track record, including 'Blade Runner 2049', 'Arrival', and 'Sicario', all of which are in my Top 50 films of all time and deserving of a perfect 10/10, along with 'Dune Part One'. 'Dune Part Two' exceeds its predecessor in every way, elevating the story in such climactic fashion that my heart and mind were positively buzzing for a solid 90 minutes. It has no weak link, no tonal inconsistency, and no extended dip in energy or over-explanation in which to lose the viewer. It is a perfect film from my perspective and likely to crack my top 5 all-time (I will reserve final judgment until I can see it in 70mm IMAX next week).\n",

The problem is: we've seen it all before.As much as I was immersed in the visuals and interesting and grand visual scenes, by the one hour point, u couldn't help but to check my watch and how much time was left. Then, it picked up again for fifteen minutes before becoming boring again.This will suffice as a sci fi experience, and I can see fans of the book loving it maybe, but it just lost me about halfway through. I won't deny the reviews and arguments that say part I was probably better.Masterpiece? Certain \"scenes\" scattered about it were, but overall, it is just too long and needs serious editing to be a true one.5/10.\n",

Beginning it there would have pulled us in to this weird SciFi world and made it clear that there was some horrific villain who would be a huge threat to Paul and his ambitions, instead we got a slow paced intro about returning a dead body. Dull)Lackluster pacing (yes, there's a lot to cover, but the narrative swings between too much happening and sudden lulls, or a weird build-up to a climax that kind of just happens out of nowhere - bang - and it's done).The lead, Timothee, falls short of charisma (he's genuinely trying, but he seems miscast)The romance feels totally unconvincing (almost as bad as that romance in Attack of the Clones).The villain, despite a cool appearance, lacks depth. Yes, he's psychotic and needs to constantly look up beneath a furrowed hairless brow to show us that, but he's not scary or threatening.Maybe I need to watch it again, but I was disappointed for sure, and I don't really know if it's just me missing something or if everyone's expectations of good films are being watered down, and we're forgetting that good movies get under your skin, whereas this one barely made a scratch.\n",

While the first film adhered somewhat closely to the storyline of Frank Herbert's book, this section wildly veers away from the source material. It would be more accurate to say it is a film adaptation using characters and some situation from the book. It also depends on spectacle rather than storytelling.Timothée Chalamet is again reasonably good as Paul. I am continually surprised and impressed by his range and ability.Zendaya is also quite good. Sadly, she is hampered by Chani being written a minor secondary character.The rest are... adequate.Dune has a rich story with significant subtext. Sadly, director Denis Villeneuve relys far too heavily on spectacle resulting in a film that is pretty, but not at all important. This is not unexpected. He has a long history of almost-great near misses. Make no mistake, he is good, and has awards that speak to that, but he is nowhere near great. And he could be.The costuming is good, but the characters are continually shown wearing partial stillsuits. At times, they are outside without one at all. No Fremen in their right minds would ever do this. I realize you need to show the principals faces and such, but good directors and costumers would find acceptable workarounds.Special effect are good.

So unlike a lot of sci-fi this story is about people and not about their clever machines.It could easily have been set during the Crusades. It has grandeur, it is expansive. It is complex.It is about belief and faith, it is full of religious fervour, about survival against the odds. It is also about revenge and justice.It is about careful manipulation, sowing the seeds of prophecy; nurturing it , of plans that span 90 generations. About knowing when to seize the moment when that time finally comes.But at the same time it is about a hero fully aware of what destruction that may bring.Dune is influential.If you've watched the Star Wars films, Dune's reluctant hero living on a desert planet with a looming empire and the battle for the galaxy will feel familiar. (After the success of the first Star Wars film , Lucas termed himself too big to sue).I have read Dune many times. I have watched the David Lynch film more times than I can remember. In fact I have watched Dune part one about five times.The casting in this version is perfect.

Despite the incredible cinematography, the first film was quite slow going and convoluted in setting up the premise. However, I needn't have worried as part two was a much simpler premise setting up the Paul Atreides' revenge story, but also gave so much action, drama and moment of pure tension. Austin Butler's psychotic portrayal of Feyd-Rautha stole the show but there were also excellent turns from Chalamet, Zendaya and the who's who of Hollywood.What is clear is that Villeneuve does scale better than any of his peers, and when the worms take front and centre in some of the biggest scenes, he shows why he is a master of his art.

That's what those two stars have purchased. Maybe there should be another half a star for Rebecca Ferguson, the only actor who earned their salary in the film. The remainder of the cast can be summed up as two entitled, spoiled young people acting like entitled, spoiled young people, surrounded by slightly more mature adults who try half heartedly to take it all seriously. You can see, on occasion, a glint in the eye of Josh Brolin or Javier Braden, trying to stifle giggles when Timothy or that funny Z girl scream in rage or brood, but maybe the thought of all the dollars pouring into their bank account helped restrain the mirth.It's easy to get carried away by the splendid graphics, but at heart a good film is characterized by brilliance in acting and storytelling, and this film has neither.Perverting the source material in favour of modern narratives is likewise a major flaw, I wonder how much longer we will have such crimes inflicted upon us. Classics are classics for a reason. It's not a complex reason. It's really simple: a great many people have enjoyed and been inspired by them, so they endure.

I am at a loss to explain why the writers have done this - as they didn't need to.The impact of Dune 2 is as tremendous as the Novels. Acting is excellent, camera work excellent, music superb. The mesmerising quality of the desert planet Arrakis is brilliantly done. This thing is breathtaking, its scale is vast.Don't listen to anyone who says the Dune films are no good! They are fantastic!\n",
            "Document 476 (Score: 0.0000): You won't regret if you watch Dune:Part two! Usually I don't write reviews, but it's impossible to not say how amazing this film is. Even if you are not sci-fi fan, you should watch this masterpiece!The huge effort of the director, the whole team who invented the decors and costumes and the amazing work of the actors are making this film unforgettable!I think the second part is even better than the first one and for this contributes mostly Austin Butler! Also the music, written by Hans Zimmer makes the audience feel deep emotions. It's unique I continue to listen the song after watching the movie.Definitely one my favourite films!\n",
