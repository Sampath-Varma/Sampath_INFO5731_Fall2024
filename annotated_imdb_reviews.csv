1,this is what hollywood needs a great story with a great directorproducer after that the best thing a studio can do is get the hell out of the way and let artists create artdune part is creative beautiful tragic and mesmerizing never once did i get bored or anticipate what was going to happen next i havent read the book so i have nothing to compare it todenis villeneuve continues to amaze me with the effort he puts into each of his films the acting in this film was top notch too we saw it in imax and the sound was earth shattering if youre gonna see this movie see it on the largest screen possible,positive
2,im going to write this as a review for both dune movies so ill include my thoughts about dune part one throughout for me the most difficult part about rating these movies is trying to judge them as they stand on their own without comparing them to the original bookas movies i think both are great the cinematography is amazing the sound design is good the acting is good i liked the visual style and how they interpreted the various technologies of the world of dune the soundtrack is good it can be a little overbearing at times but the music in part two felt like an improvement on this from part one one of the biggest complaints people had with both movies is the pacing saying that the first movie was dragging and the second was rushing i agree with the sentiments about the latter but personally i enjoyed the slower pacing of the first dune movie the second movie definitely moves quickly through its first half then it slows down a lot in the second half before rushing to its conclusionthe casting is good for the most part i personally disagree with casting rebecca ferguson but ill get into that more later in the first movie i wasnt especially impressed with timothe chalamet as paul but i think he does better in the role in the second part jason momoa was a perfect pick for duncan idaho and oscar isaac did a great job as duke leto stellan skarsgard was a good choice for baron harkonnen but i think he could have been written better i was really looking forward to seeing christopher walken as the emperor shaddam but unfortunately he felt pretty lifeless and didnt bring very much energy to the scenes he was inoverall as they stand on their own the dune movies are great films i dont know if id call them the defining scifi movies of the st century like other people are saying but theyre still very good definitely rewatchable and i would recommend themnow moving on to comparing them to the books because once you start doing that you get to the more disappointing side of these movies one of the biggest issues with both movies especially the second is that they almost completely leave out the ecological message of the book this is a book that has been used as a textbook in environmental science classes but i guess the filmmakers decided that message wasnt important enough the fremen are shown to be working towards terraforming dune into a green world slowly but surely making wind traps and planting grasses to fix the dunes in place its a goal that they are working towards with total commitment even though they know that it wont be realized for several generations thats a powerful message that i think a lot more people need to hear nowadays especially in reference to the issue of climate change the movie barely mentions this goal at all which i think is a disservice to the original story and it diminishes the fremen as charactersi think the fundamental issue that these movies have with their adaptations is an understandable one but that it couldve been solved in a better way the main issue with adapting the book is that the characters are very difficult to relate to most of them are superhumans who have insane abilities for the movies a lot of the main characters are altered to make them more relatable to the audience which is an understandable change for some characters this greatly improves them from the book such as duncan idaho and duke leto for others like chani and jessica it reduces the strength of their characters which ill explain more lateradditionally the book has a lot of complex concepts and story plots that it never stops to fully explain to the reader youre just supposed to pick it up as you go along and reread it to understand making it a little obtuse dune is very dialogueheavy with a lot of the action happening in the background or only described briefly to remedy this the movies remove some of the more complex topics and add more action scenes which are exciting and well choreographed but in the second movie they start feeling repetitive and redundant and they overpower the more intricate plot pointswhile the first movie cleverly managed to insert a lot of exposition without feeling like it was constantly lore dumping part two feels like its more afraid to explain things than the first possibly because of complaints that nothing happened in the first movie the result of this is that the second movie is much more actionheavy but it still wants to include the complex topics from the book so what we get is a bunch of action sequences with scenes of political complexities strung in between them but without the full explanations necessary to clarify them its easy to understand why people who havent read the books would feel confused by this the movie barely takes the time to explain whats happening before its moving on to the next scene of fremen blowing up spice haulersgetting into direct comparisons to the book now and starting with the first movie my two biggest issues with the first movie was how they changed jessica and how they dumbed down the mentats starting with mentats they are a hugely important part of all of the dune books thufir hawat is essentially a main character in the first book and peter de vries is a terrifying mastermind behind the harkonnen plans part of what triggers pauls first vision of the coming jihad in his name is that his mother tells him he was trained as a mentat from birth without his knowledge in the movie the word mentat is never said once pauls mentat training isnt brought up thufir hawat is just a guy who rolls his eyes back in his head says something smart and then disappears at the halfway mark and peter de vries dies of poisoning how disappointingbut what i think is the worse change that they made from the book is how they changed jessicas character while the dune books get much more feminist as they go on the first book has very few female characters however jessica makes for a very strong main character she has complete control over her mind and body and through her bene gesserit training she has almost superhuman strength speed and can control others with the voice her internal monologue also shows that shes almost always two steps ahead of everyone except paul in the movies jessica feels much weaker in the first movie shes almost always crying or on the verge of tears which makes it a lot believable when she starts killing harkonnens with her bear hands and it makes the scene in the tent when paul gets his vision the only part of the book where jessica openly grieves much less powerfulmoving on to the second movie is where the changes get more disappointing the movie begins with paul jessica and the fremen fighting the harkonnens in some battle between the fight with jamis and them getting to sietch tabr which wasnt in the book and felt like it was added for the sake of starting with an action sequence after the fight jessica throws up involuntarily again as a bene gesserit she should have total control over her body and it doesnt make sense for her to do that even though shes pregnantspeaking of jessicas child alia isnt really a character in this at least not like she was in the book i can understand this i had no idea how they were going to handle having a toddler who walks and talks like an adult and kills a man and they handled it by having jessica not give birth during the movie they also dont really explain how alia is preborn which is a piece of information that people who didnt read the book could probably useonce paul and jessica get to sietch tabr things feel a lot different the book describes the interiors of the sietch as being covered with drapery rugs and cushions there are classrooms plastic factories and workshops the movie doesnt show this at all the sietch interior is all smooth carved stone rather than natural rock walls theres no textiles to be seen and essentially only the water reservoir is shown in general the depiction of the fremen in the movie is much worse than the book the fremen are a very tightknit community where people understand each others needs so well that they dont even need to communicate them out loud when jessica feels like she needs a coffee a fremen with coffee simply appears without her giving an order in the movie the fremen are three things good at stabbing people fanatic believers in paul or people who hate the mahdi prophecy and dont believe in paul in the book this dissenting faction against paul isnt really present and chani definitely isnt part of it i can understand that the filmmakers probably added it to help drive home the antihero worship message which a lot of people missed from the book but it could have been executed betteri also disliked how they changed chani in the books she very easily falls for paul and gives him unwavering support and i think its fine that they wanted to make that more nuanced for the movies but i dont like the way they did it the movie wants us to think that they love each other even though it constantly shows chani ranting against the prophecy and disagreeing with pauls actions in the end she leaves paul after he agrees to marry the emperors daughter irulan even though in the book he makes it clear that he is only marrying her for politics refuses to even touch her and has three children with chani instead this ending will definitely complicate things if they do go through with adapting dune messiah to complete the film trilogyim running out of room to write and most people probably wont read this anyway because of the length so ill just say again that i enjoyed the movies and think theyre good but some of the changes they made especially in part two were disappointing and could have been executed better,positive
3,had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown awaydune part is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind as a big fan of the game of thrones franchise its been a long time since ive encountered this level of worldbuilding and epicness the plot and story development are carried out in an aweinspiring manner throughout the movie progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectlydenis villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time and if it was up to me i would keep him in these highbudget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does the film received praise from many great filmmakers the most notable being christopher nolan the dark knight trilogy oppenheimer who very accurately compared villeneuves achievement in this film to the empire strikes back of the modern erawould highly recommend to rewatch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better though its not completely necessary since the movie is pretty selfcontained more specifically one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part of course for those who really want to enjoy the story theres no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one however even those who watched it a few years ago and dont remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the pt and will understand all the important detailseven the smaller ones nonideally even someone who hasnt watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one as it is very selfcontained despite relying heavily on the first moviean impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writerstimothe chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play zendaya also gives a very good performance with significantly more screen time than in the first movie austin butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain rebecca ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year and javier bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie in addition to them the film is filled with toptier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazinglyhans zimmers score is masterful just as youd expect and one step up from the oscar winning and grammy nominated score of pt technical aspects such as vfx production design sound editing etc are all top notch and awardsworthy the action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine denis direction is impeccable and the story is absolutely fascinating continuing to develop characters from pt even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing charactersin my personal opinion the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect while the first part was excellent it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel in part the story reaches its climax with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades befitting the complex work frank herbert wrote many years agoi believe and surely hope this movie will be a major player in the next award season belowtheline wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now but i hope it will get some love in abovetheline categories such as direction and even best picture perhaps to break stigmas presented against the fantasyscifi genre in recent years at the academy as a big fan of the genre unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period maybe its time for a movie like this to triumph once againwhile the movie serves as a great wrapup to the story introduced in pt in my opinion it could serve as an even better setup to a possible masterpiece in dune messiah which i really hope will get greenlit soondont miss the opportunity to catch this movie on imax since i believe its an historic piece of epicfantasyscifi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genreextremely recommended,positive
4,phenomenal stuff ill probably calm down tomorrow but right now my hearts beating like crazy and my brains screaming its a bloody masterpiece this is one of the few movies that i didnt try to control my expectations beforehand and it still surpassed them in many wayspower over spice is power over all that kinda turned out to be a lie at the end as the movie starts i felt an immediate sense of tension through its score its a cinematic experience i cant imagine feeling the same lying at home in bed watching in headphones the resonating vibrations as the sounds reverberate through the theater created an epic atmospherewhen part one came out people said it was game of thrones in space i wasnt really taken by that as much especially since people said the same about apple tvs foundation series so i just enjoyed the movie as dune and bore no comparisons after watching part two however i see it the world building the politics the epic grandeur of it allhowever the first half of dune part two is pretty grounded and calm delving into the lives of the fremen it almost feels like two distinct movies the first half intricately setting the stage for the climactic third act and reinforcing character connections established in dune part one unlike the part ones focus on lore this movie is more devotiondriven also resembling a political narrative especially knowing of the hidden puppeteers behind the empire the result appears to be an intricate web of schemes involving the empire the witchadvisor womencant spell their names lol and the barons family despite the emperors pulling the strings the barons family still felt like main antagonist to methe second half of the movie is where we see the epic scale of dune the movies not quick paced but you couldnt tell i was absolutely immersed in iti absolutely loved the kind the mahdi is too humble to say he is the mahdi theatre burst out in laughter it felt weird i wasnt expecting any humour its funnier than i expected more lively than the first dune movie id already seen the usulwormriding scene from the dune part one reopening bonus content i was still just as excited and it didnt spoil a thingthe visual brilliance as expected was stunning elevating every aspect the authenticity of the scenes made it feel as if characters were immersed in the environment rather than merely placed against a green screen i loved the portrayal of time passing through pauls changing eyes the longer he stays the bluer his eyes get despite how lively it is the plot while progressing at a measured pace remains engaging drawing attention away from its deliberate slowness it has much more action the battles were absolutely epic i feel like they could have been longer but they still captivated mejessica disappears for a while but just when i thought that she showed up other than paul and zendeya the rest of the cast doesnt really get as much screen time as youd think i loved the babyembryofeatus scenes batista with no mask in the desert while his whole teams suited up was badass i love him in darker roles although i think some moments felt overly animated but it gave an effective contrast to austin butler though i couldnt wait to see what his character was like very fierce intimidating and psycho the girl shivering with the plate in her hands before the gladiator games made me chuckle butler did also sound like the baron at timesdune part two stands steady on its own it felt complete compared to the more introductory feel of part one despite this i still felt like it lays groundwork for dune part threemessiah leaving a sense of setup the movie while feeling like a precursor still manages to provide a more conclusive ending i also think you should watch part one first if that has to be said and the prospect of a backtoback viewing sounds like a fun afternoonone thing i can complain about is stilger i have mixed feelings in part one javier was fierce and was my favorite character in this movie though hes depicted as a religious fanatic for the most part it was done well but i still miss the stilgar who walked up to duke leto atreides with no disregard this felt like a different person still fierce just differentloved austin butler though i wasnt sure what to expect as i tried my best to avoid trailers and teasers apart from the dune part one bonus content that short lady in charge of extracting the water of life had some insane calves on her im extremely jealouswhile i was initially not convinced about timothe chalamet as the lead he truly owns the role in the sequel displayed acting facets id not seen before from him the movie essentially unfolds as paul atreides comingofage story with zendaya delivering an amazing performance the first act focusing on their love story adds depth to the events at the movies end zendayas portrayal transcends the typical love story i hope her role extends into dune messiah and hopefully adds further complexity to her characterwe see paul undergo some transformations from being the son of royalty to experiencing love the narrative takes a surprising turn when he assumes authority in the third act although i liked it it felt a bit rushed but i found solacelogic with the water of life spiritual poison where drinking it resulted in a profound shift in your personality the contrast between the before and after versions of paul as well as jessica is striking so it kinda made sense to mei think watching this movie at home wont do it justice its clearly made for the big screens if you can its pretty epic and i think itll remain memorable as one of s best movies despite only being february i absolutely loved it,positive
5,if you liked or loved the first one the same will apply for this one personally i loved this one even more and i think general audiences will as well so i hope it does well at the box office because i need dune messiah now this is everything i love about going to the movies also hans zimmerfor book readers id say this one takes more liberties than the first but they were changes i liked some for the better even for the most part it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered the biggest change being no time jump therefore a certain character doesnt fully appear in the movie contrary to the book though they still use the character in a different way that i liked personallyi know its early in the year but you can lock some oscar nominations for this movie best picture best director best adapted screenplay best editing best cinematography best score best sound best visual effects best costume best production design best makeup and hopefully rebecca ferguson this time for best supporting actress i guess thats pretty much every category now that ive typed it out lol,positive
6,as with the first film the production was beautiful i loved the opening scenes with the harkonnen soldiers the arena fight between austin butler and the last atreides robert yuan actors names was fantastic the battles with the harvesters were phenomenalthe script however left me a little bit disappointed what about the guild navigators and how were the worms used after they came through the pass in the mountains opened up by the atomics there was only one sequence of the initial charge marvelous sequence when the gunships entered but then nothing the sardurkar were not given enough respect in this film there was only one scene that showed them respect and that was when they rose up from the fallen sand and rock debris and stood their ground preparing for the oncoming onslaught instead of panicking other than that i felt the film should have spent more time on tactical combat scenes in what was supposed to be an epic battle at the end of the film maybe trim time off of the other dragged out sequences in the film the first movie did a better job with the sardaukar you actually feared them the epic battle at the end of this movie was less than epic and poor bautista they should not have made him act like such a wimp should have had a more glorious fight even in retreatas much as i like walken i thought he was poorly cast to be emperor the film had a perfect actor for the personality this is villeneuves fault he picked himthe script also fails to emphasize that paul is the kwisatz haderach at the end of the movie pauls initial ability to vaguely see the future comes from the centuries of genetic tinkering of the women of the ben gesserat but after he drinks the water of life and not only survives but develops the ability to see an individuals past as evident by the scenes in the fremen temple where he looks at individuals and describes their past and more clearly sees optional future outcomes and after he actually fulfills all of the prophecies of the fremen the story is true he really is the messiah of arrakis justifying the religion and he really is the kwisatz haderach a man with abilities that no other man has but the film appears to gloss over this shame he is not just some populist charismatic man blamed by the likes of zendayas character for perceived fooling anyone to follow him and falling for the appeal of power and giving up his principles he is more than thatmy critique of the first film was not enough emotion well part does a better job especially after paul survives the water of life and becomes the antihero all hell breaks loose and zendayas character being a more independent women than the film was interesting albeit the combat skills or luck were not realistic unless you buy that the sardaukar were that inept part was a better drama than part but part has some great action sequences besides the disappointments i mentioned earlier not a perfect film for this dune admirer,positive
7,this is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice just by talking about it it is the kind of experience you had once but you never thought you would get again until this movie proves you wrongthis movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of all timeeverything in this movie was top notch dennis villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of scifi movies but just filmmaking in general this was a demonstration of power in what you can achieve with filmmakingi beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find this will be an experience that will stick with you foreveri thought the real blockbuster was dead but i was wrong this is the cinematic experience i cravednow i am gonna watch this movie again and maybe again then i am gonna read the books,positive
8,this was a perfect sequel to denis part one it accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of having this film will go down as one of the best in scififantasy and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted not in the longest time has a franchise and a singular movie captivated me in such a way this story these characters this planet dune lives rentfree in my mind you would be doing yourself a disservice not seeing this film in imax as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by hans zimmer are so immersive you feel like you are a part of every scene this movie is a masterpiece in storytelling,positive
9,a monumental piece of cinemapaced to perfection uniquely beautiful thoughtprovoking beyond thrilling with unbelievable cinematography and flawless worldbuilding backed up by the best ensemble performance in a blockbuster since fellowship of the ring an entire production on their agame its an incredible technical achievement everyone on set was clearly aware they were working on something special denis villeneuves love for dune shines through every stunning frame part of his adaptation was wonderful but here he improves on it in every way it just doesnt get better than this,positive
10,i have to start by saying that i absolutely loved the first movie i wasnt familiar with the story and i went with zero expectations only to be completely stunned by the masterful artwork that was dune part the music the sound the visuals the entire world and its atmosphere the characters even the plot i found everything beautifully crafted and a breath of fresh air for the scifi genrei am not familiar with the source material so this is considering only the movies and while i had a deep desire to love this second part specially considering the reviews it has been getting and how much i loved the first one i couldnt help but feel a slight disappointment lets start with the positives the cinematography is consistently out of this world it is a visual wonder a mix of practical effects with cgi that blends in perfectly the intense and dramatic sound effects associated with a thrilling and daunting soundtrack delivers and of course the acting is consistently good this time around it was great to see javier bardens character being developed and bringing some great topics to the tablewhat makes me wonder the most to be honest is how different both the first movie and the second are being reviewed by the general public for once its running time is considerable almost hours and somehow it feels strangely rushed its a bit odd to explain but in other words we get so many scenes that feel that dont contribute at all to the narrative and out of the blue we transition to a scene where the main character changes the demeanor entirely without much build up leading to it the movie spends so much time trying to connect paul to the fremens yet it fails to explore his own inner motivations the moment we see his character changing it gives you the feeling that you missed somethingpauls betrayal to chani also feels a bit irrelevant since the chemistry built on the first movie seems to just dissipate the relationship with his mother is also very odd and inconsistent her character becomes dark fairly early in the movie in one moment she is her beloved mother and without much shared screen time he then seems to almost despise her by the end of the film without the audience having a deeper understanding of their relationship dynamicthe newly introduced villains are one dimensional and having austin butlers character seemed pointless there was no goal for him he gets killed off almost instantly alongside with the baron who got so much build from the first movie an a list of actors like florence pugh christopher walken and la seydoux all of them couldve been amazing characters but get zero chance of showing thatan entire plot with pauls sister goes out the drain as well messing with time started to become promising but it leads nowhere i mean i could go on in short the movie had many plot gaps didnt develop the characters properly poorly introduced the newcomers and relied heavily on its outstanding cinematography and soundits a shame because i cant tell you how excited i was to write a praising review but this was my honest opinion which apparently doesnt seem to align with the majoritya lot of scenes drag without much substance to it the highlight of the film was javier bardens character and the messages behind the dangerous of the concept of a messiai am of course hopeful for the third movie maybe with my expectations now lowered it becomes a great experience all over again,positive
11,i just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible see for yourself in imax the characters acting screenplay world building storytelling score actions sequences cinematography and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece denis villeneuve provides a masterclass of filmmaking the casting continuation was perfect all the way through with great new addons timothee chalamet is believable raw and real as paul atriedes he was flawless as the lead zendaya rebecca ferguson javier bardem and josh brolin are fantastic per usual stellan skarsgard and dave bautista continue their evil austin butler steals the show as feydrautha and florence pugh and christopher walken are solid fresh castsoverall dune part two is an inspiring visually stunning scifi spectacle and an incredible collision of myth adventure and destiny on a galactic scale its a fantastic piece of filmmaking rarely seen in modern day cinema,positive
12,dune part is an epic movie slickly made and visually stunningbut i had to explain quite a bit to the friends around me who had not read the book especially the water of life scene and the final battlethe movie had almost a hour run time but it felt overlong because villenue focuses too much on spectacle on very little on substanceit is a beautiful movie but it feels like it has no soul the emotional connection between paul and chani so vital to the story is completely lacking and unbelievable the two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screeni am certain zendaya is a fine actress in some things but she has basically facial expressions here and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at paul i found her to be the worst part of this moviethe final fight scene is short choppy and a mess it felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling the harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish the ending was super abrupt and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequeli want to reiterate that this isnt a bad movie villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing but he cant give life to individual charactersit is like he cant see the trees for the forest,positive
13,first of all part one was pretty good fast pace some talking but not much a fast pace movie i enjoyed overall a very good moviethe overall part is boring not the actors fault though rather its the script that is dragging its feet nowhere because its badly written so bad it becomes a snooze at the end of the day its boring and weve lost interest characters spend some much time talking philosophizing whining and complaining you wonder why a production would spend millions on such a badly written boring story thats the trend these days when a network wants to cut down expenses its making characters blob to deathchalamet not my cup of tea in this part he looks out of place feels more like a choir boy rather than an action movie heropart misses the mark,negative
14,as an avid movie fan i see plenty of movies many average many bad a few good and once in while great but i use the word great scarcely dune is better than great oppenheimer was a great movie but i wouldnt rush back to see it a second time in the near future dune i would see it again tomorrow the story is on par to the star wars legacy the acting on par with oppenheimer the sfx better than the two movies just mentioned combined when the movie finished over and half hours i still wanted more the emotional ride was like nothing i can remember from any movie i can remember best movie of the year i dont think so best movie of a generation is more akin to what i saw wish i could give it stars,positive
15,it was a visual spectacle and refreshingly it lived up to and beyond the hypehowever for me there was a niggling itch through the movie something about chanis character that bothered me and only grew as the movie progressedi googled to see if others shared this feeling all i could find was praise for the character however there was consensus that she was written very different from the booki finally found an article that helped describe the disconnect i felt with chanithe following is not my writing and all credit is given to kara kennedy herberts novel dune chani has a range of roles and avenues of strength influence and power she becomes pauls love but begins as the young woman who introduces him to a foreign desert land in his visions and the one who guides him as he integrates into the fremen community she is a fierce young fighter as well as a religious leader in her role as sayyadina standing apart from paul to oversee the cultural rites she is a young mother who finally wins the approval of her childs bene gesserit grandmother jessica and saves paul from a long coma she is wise enough to understand the political necessities of paul legally marrying a princess and trusted by him to negotiate the marriage contractchanis attachment to paul is an important part of the story but it does not reduce her to being a simple onedimensional female character chani is an essential window into fremen culture her multifaceted character challenges stereotypes about women of faith and women in nonwestern cultures that continue to be debated about in the real worldmeanwhile the filmsdune part one and especially dune part twomake substantial changes to chanis character in the name of making her more independent which end up making her more stereotypically masculine she is mainly a fighter who has a fling with paul she is not a mother and not a religious figure instead rejecting any association with religious beliefs or practices she is almost a second jamis except that she has a brief romantic entanglement with paulchanis disavowal of the religious elements in her culture arguably represents a contemporary western cynical view taking over the story that religion must be purged to empower the individual to free women from their shackles this change in chanis character appears to be intended to make her more free and complex because shes not a follower and she doesnt believe she can be dismissive of paul and sees little to learn from him their relationship is then not a mutual exchange a partnership but something she has to turn aside from to be independentthe underlying message is that if chani were a woman of faith like in the book she couldnt be an interesting complex character just a follower whos oppressed the takeaway is that the fremens religious system is bad because it was influenced by outsiders that faith makes people weak and that being a fighter and killer is preferable to being like the women who live in the sietches wear headscarves and discuss religious ideas or who carry the tribes ancestors in their bodieschani may also reflect a deeper fear in the increasingly secular west about the power of religion in the st century it is possible that the idea in dune of an oppressed group militarily united under a religious banner drawing strength from a belief in something greater than themselves is still too much to put on screen in an adaptation especially given the books middle eastern influences if viewers need to be reassured that not everyone believes that there is division that someone is the rational one to turn away from the fundamentalists then chani offers this she is the contrasting perspective the voice of socalled reason who questions the religious indoctrinationbut ultimately the considerable changes made to chanis character for denis villeneuves film adaptations alienate her from her lover and her culture and strip her of the many roles she has in the book any complexity gained by her skepticism is offset by the loss of her influence and authority and her place in her community chanis depiction in the films worryingly suggests that the price of being an independent woman means being faithless and alone,positive
16,visually and musically stunning like the first movie with excellent action scenes casting superb for the most part aside from walken as emperor which in my opinion was not a great cast nothing against christopher as an actor but he just doesnt seem all that well in that roll but still good enough to get the job done also i am not the biggest fan of zendaya visually shes a good cast for chani but her constant angry face and little chemistry with paul is distracting chalamet and ferguson absolutely nailed the rolesmy main issues with the movie are incomplete or reduxed storytelling and that the director decided not to include possiblly some of the most important and fascinating elements and scenes at least for me from the storythe werding way i was disappointed since the technology was available that the directoror did not incorporate the bene gesserit werding way martial art of paul and jessica where the moments were so fast that it almost appeared as teleportation this should have been in the movie to emphasize how incredibly skilled mysterious and godlike paul and jessica would be to the fremen and the viewerjessicas reverend mother transformation was not explained properly and seriously underperformed by the writing the explanation of the magnitude and significance of what reverend mother is was not construed properly in the movie reverend mothers were seriously overpowered beings with strong powers and influence the fact that there was another hidden reverend mother on dune was not signified properly the transformation in the book was much more poignant and there was very little explanation to jessicas daughter aliah and the abomination jessicas role was seriously deminished in the second moviekwisatz haderach i found the significance and explaition and the powers were inadequately explained and explored by the movie as mentioned earlier the significance of powers of reverend mothers but it wasnt shown how much of a big deal the kwisatz haderach actually was and how much more powerful he was his precience past memories should have been more visually and nuancedit felt like the director was too cautious or afraid to explore the more mysterious and transcedental parts of the story which in my opinion are the core of the story without it feels almost pointless and like a different plot where paul just fights to free the fremen and jessica gets a nun spiritual job with the fremen while paul is shown as a gifted fighter with some sort of special abilities that dont look all that different to anyone else where in fact pauls fighting when using weirding way would almost be incompreheble to the fremenin summary the movie is a visual feast with a theatrical presence of a masterpiece but fails capture the magnitude of the main characters and their abilities and in essence what the power struggle not just for spice is all about could have been a,positive
17,we have waited many many years for a movie of this caliber im years old a female grandmother and retired this was the best movie i have ever seen i dont tend to like sifi movies so i went along with my husband as a favor the length of this movie wasnt even noticed by us it wasnt long enough to be honest we wanted more it ended and we werent done yet we know how long it takes for sequels to come along so who knows if ill still be on the planet to see it i hope i am and i hope they can do it justice the last time i remember a movie being this good i was in high school in the s do not miss the opportunity to see this movie in the theatre crazy good,positive
18,dune has been successfully put to the big screen not only is this a good adaptation it passes with flying colorsthe character arc of paul atreides is fascinating and complex i love how they delved into his psyche and motivations so prevalently in this movie he is reluctant to take up the messianic mantle because he knows its a lie but things go according to his vision and he becomes a morally complex character religious fantacism takes hold of the fremenit is up for interpretation what kind of character paul becomes is he a tyrant was it the only path what does religion have to do with it paul takes hold of the bene gesserit lie by exploiting faiththis leads to other questions can one truly trust the arm of flesh the frailty of man leaders have come and gone throughout history bringing different idealsones own morality comes into play agency is vital to the human experience man will always falter this leads to questions of a higher power and his role is there a god above what are the implications of thatwe dont get stories like this in hollywood anymore there is no happy ending in dune and one can only ponder the moral complexities of it the book and movie have made me contemplate many things and i deeply appreciate stories like thatothers have already applauded the effects acting and script so i wont go into that too much here what i will say is it was the best looking movie i have ever seen everything looked lived in the fight scenes were choreographed masterfully each actor gave outstanding performances hans zimmer gives a mesmerizing soundtrackfrank herberts vision was honored masterfully well done denis villeneuve,positive
19,saw an early screening of this film at the tilton square theatre in new jersey and i was completely blown away from the opening scene all the way until the credits i never felt bored which is impressive for a hour and minute filmi dont want to write too much here i prefer anyone reading this with the slightest bit of interest in the film to go see it immediately it doesnt release worldwide until march st so grab tickets and i would highly recommended you see it in imax if possible almost the entirety of the movie is filmed with imax camerasthis movie is an absolute visual spectacle probably going to win a couple oscars for sound editing picture etc and the fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically like i stated in the beginning see this film,positive
20,like the first part the second part is visually stunning though having read the book twice i regret to say that unlike the david lynch version from the eighties de villeneuve almost deliberately destresses the mysticalmythical core of the story this makes for an impressive viewing that somehow left me unsatisfied in de villeneuves hands the story becomes one of political grandstanding which is but part of what the book is about both in relation to the hidden ways of the fremen and the nature and mission of paul and his mother for example in the second part those scenes where paul atreides becomes the kwizatz haderach are rather weak and not very convincinghaving left this essence out of the movies they become a bit of an emptied out visual experience a kind of secular profane dune still nice but also a bit disappointing,positive
21,i just watched this in imax and it was one of the greatest movie experiences i have ever had everything from part one was done even better in part two and the story was much more interesting the outfits were so unique and really well made whenever i thought it was starting to move a little slow something insane happens and im instantly drawn back into the world of dune that denis has remade and expanded on so much all the shots of the different worlds were just breathtaking the last hour of the movie is by far some of the best made cinema in awhile and the action was so good the last fight was awesome as well you fought well atreides,positive
22,the biggest problem with this movie is one that has crept into hollywood over the last decade and noone seems to really acknowledge the actors mumble their lines in such low tones you have to turn the volume up full blast then when the character yells the audience feels the actor is more powerful then heshe really is but in reality they are boring and wooden not to mention your ears fall off when their is a sudden explosion during the mumbling gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone like george clooneyoverall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first hours all the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly dont go to movies to be entertained between the acting of zendaya dave bautista austin butler and florence pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any actingits time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not,negative
23,the bad the dialogue is clunky and robotic with too much name use shoutout to the live scriptreading from the princess the constant exposition dumps are spoon fed to you as to ensure you can digest the baby food unlike the first illogical fights attack the mining structure and lose men to launch a bazooka at the thopter and only then use your energy beam weapon that instantly destroys the giant structures and when they beat the emperor why didnt the bene gesserits use the voice on paul or the fremen why did the emperor get to choose a champion to fight paul after all hed done how the hell are the fremen at the exact same time able to mount like worms at the exact same time and use the worms to attack the harkonnens while we never see a single dismount pointless scenes you wanna be a fremen walk from here to there and back never shows him complete the task never shows him being accepted as a fremen because he accomplished itthis movie plays like a super long episode of a poorly written tv series thats trying to cram as much from the book as possible onto the screen again completely unlike the first,positive
24,in the quiet embrace of ink and page a story unfolded timeless and sage through the lens of a filmmakers artistry its essence soared a masterpiece for all to see i think denis villeneuve has just made the most visually stunning epic story of a movie thats ever been made the most powerful story of a movie ever been told in the last years there has been no movies with this scale resulting in not just a piece of a film no more but a piece of art its what infinity war and endgame looks like if its not a superhero for kids entertainment type movie the more adult version of star wars dune has just become the most intriguing fascinating and admirable movie world that we should always get excited about right now marvel universe are over star wars universe are over let the maestro denis villeneuve handle all of this if they are gonna make another one im glad to be able to say that i think dune part two was a masterpiece i havent felt this awe feeling and just pure fascinated at a movie like this in quite a long time i have nothing to complain about the story and the visual of the film because i felt most of it if not all of it was just perfect i cannot describe how incredible the visual of the film was how mesmerizing the sound and the score of the film was and how amazing all of the performance was props to timothe chalamet im not surprise if he gets the nomination for best actor for the oscars next year he totally deserve it and absolutely needs to be considered each dialogue was great each scene from one to another felt important and worth it action scenes are some of the best ive seen in a while and the perfect stabilisation between the action and the narration scene are very well done hours and minutes of pure grand epic film fills with the most stunning visual that you could possibly imagine and an intriguing story telling that kept you going for the whole duration its that good its that epic its that great mastering others is strength mastering yourself is true power overall i could see both denis villeneuve dune finally get the influential recognition years from now and specifically part two being also one of the greatest sequel ever made dune part two was easily the best films of the year so far it is more than what he supposed to deliver,positive
25,this movie is a visual masterpiece that will be studied for decades the colors are vivid the lighting is gorgeous and the cgi is mostly indistinguishable from realitythat said despite being almost hours long the story felt hugely condensed it felt like each scene gives you the bare minimum to understand whats happening but elaborates on nothing it felt like it wants you to immerse yourself in a unique and complex world but gives every setting only a few minutes of time before hopping straight to the next for example the training of paul we never see him learn how to ride the sandworm so when he succeeds it doesnt feel as triumphant as it would have otherwise the harkonnens are also much less intimidating than they were before most of their screentime is comprised of them trying and failing to farm spice on arrakis until they are defeated by paul and the fremen at the end without much difficulty they should have put up more of a fight lastly i know from sources that an ecological message the was very important in the book was emmited completely from the film the fremen speak of bringing green back to arrakis but thats all we ever see them dopart of it may be a limitation of the format if one must adapt a book full of complex lore than either a trilogy or even a serialization may be the better option as you get more time to explain everything i know that a third film is coming but its not based on the same book anymore and while i havent read any of the books i dont believe i should i believe that film should stand on its own two feet and this one does its legs are long and slender with just the bare minimum of muscle required to stand but it stands nonethelss,positive
26,dune part two is simply denis villeneuves magnum opus in his filmography ive loved this directors work since blade runner and arrival he did an excellent job placing his vision on the first dune but here villeneuve cranks his direction times the structure setup visuals sound and story are crafted in ways that are hard for me to put in words due to how everything came together so miraculously the acting is also topnotch timothe chalamet in particular is unbelievably phenomenal and zendaya does a great job as well austin butler rebecca ferguson and florence pugh are also excellent denis never lets you out of this experience the pure weight of the film is presented through astounding narratives rich cinematography an epic story and mesmerizing action sequences that will make your seat rumble if you watch this on the big screenthere are quite a handful of thrilling moments that i still have no idea how they came out this good in the end denis villeneuve is truly a sorcerer in the scifi genre every frame and detail in his films are captivating as hell and its no different here in the slightestdune part two made me leave the theater feeling inspired theres so much to take away from this masterpiece definitely my favorite movie of this year as of now bring on dune part three as fast as possible,positive
27,this movie more than accomplished all of the promises it set out absolutely mesmerizing experience i loved the first movie and thought it would be an impossibly difficult task to surpass it but denis villeneuve has once again proven himself as the most promising scifi director of this age i find that this installment of the series picks up its pace quickly and reaches its peak near the end of the film contrary to the first film where most of the action was packed into the middle dune part two displays a more relaxed tone from the start to the middle of the movie however the mood shifts to match the occasion and finally leaves you somewhat distraught as the consequences of the characters choices surely lead to a path they cannot return from the cinematography by greig fraser is once again fantastic the mixture of his naturalistic style and the scifi genre leads to a grounded universe while still retaining the wonderous and whimsical aspects of science fiction each decision on how planets and characters are portrayed demonstrates the care and attention paid to how audiences interpret them you understand the harkonnen the emperor the fremen the bene gesserit and the remnants of house atreides in one look at the way they are shown the score is once again sublime hans zimmer once again proves himself as the definitive motion picture composer his ability to craft largerthanlife scores with his ability to understand the differences between each character and culture present in this film is nothing short of perfection recurring themes and motifs are present throughout the movie and paired with the visuals and the performances which are also incredible form a modern day masterpiece crafted meticulously by masters of their respective fields rebecca ferguson timothe chalamet javier bardem austin butler and zendaya give wonderful performances with the first three being standouts overall this movie deserves the universal praise it has received and might just interest those who didnt even enjoy the first installment of the series,positive
28,the movie picks up right where the first film left off and while i personally go crazy over the direction of this film it comes with its share of challengesthe tops visuals denis villeneuves vision of arrakis is absolutely beautiful and something you would want to look at the desert landscapes and the intricate details of the fremens world are portrayed with such precision and care every frame is so certain in its storytimothe as paul atreides wow brought nuanced performance that captures pauls every situation struggle with perfectionfinally zendaya gets more screen time as chani as she should the chemistry that she and timothee had on screen added a muchneeded emotional layer to the film the relationship felt authentic and grounded providing a human touch amidst the grandiose settingthe flaws the pacing is a significant issue at times the movie feels like its dragging especially during some of the longer more introspective scenes these moments while beautiful can feel a bit too drawn out and risk losing the audiences attention its a film that demands patience and not everyone will appreciate this slowburn approach the plot itself remains dense and complex staying true to the novel for fans of the book its a joy to see such a faithful adaptation however for those who arent familiar with the source material the story can be confusing and hard to follow there are many characters political factions and subplots to keep track of and the film doesnt always make it easy to understand whats going on a bit more exposition or simplification could have gone a long way in making the film more accessible to a broader audienceanother area where the film falls short is in its emotional resonance while the performances are strong theres a certain coldness to the story the epic scope and the focus on political intrigue sometimes overshadow the personal human elements i found myself appreciating the film intellectually more than emotionally its a grand impressive spectacle but it doesnt always connect on a deeper more personal level the action scenes when they come are thrilling and wellexecuted the battles are intense and the use of practical effects combined with cgi creates a believable and immersive experience the sandworms iconic to the dune universe are particularly well done evoking both awe and terror hans zimmers score deserves a special mention his music elevates the film to another level adding a haunting otherworldly quality that perfectly matches the tone and scale of the story its powerful and evocative enhancing the impact of the visual storytellingin conclusion dune part is a visually stunning and ambitious film that stays true to its source material it offers strong performances particularly from timothe chalamet and zendaya and creates an immersive world that is a joy to get lost in however its slow pacing complex plot and emotional detachment can make it a challenging watch fans of the first film and the book will likely appreciate it but it may not resonate as strongly with a broader audience its a film that demands patience and attention rewarding those who are willing to dive deep into its intricate world but potentially alienating those looking for a more straightforward or emotionally engaging experience,positive
29,after watching the advanced screening we were blown away by part of dune it continues seamlessly after part with the same masterful soundtracks action scenes and actingthe movie flew by despite it being almost three hours the pacing was incredibly well done and nothing felt too fast or too slowthe cgi was incredibly realistic and the characters were portrayed so well by the lead actors the chemistry between the characters felt so real nothing felt fake or forcedits truly difficult finding a movie that contains everything flawless screenplay writing sound acting and pacing but dune does it allone of the best movies of for sure,positive
30,this movie has the same problems as part one the editing in this is terrible scenes dont connect they start an assignment or story branch then immediately cut to another completely new set of tasks and characters with their own motivations and interests no idea is complete nothing gets resolved and the dialogue is horrendousthese movies can only appeal to the fans of the books because the story is too disjointed for any casual to follow if you havent read the books you wont understand anything thats happening here what we have here is a movie that is really pretty it maxes out in the visuals category the sound was hit or miss but the plot pacing and characters were all badnot a masterpiece sorry,negative
31,i did enjoy the movie but i saying its as good as dark knight will be a huge overstatementenough good things have already been said about this movie so ill just point out the negatives all viallians feel quite weak bland and never seem to pose any real threat bautistas character is a joke baron isnt threatening and the new villian being called as good as joker by some people also feels very generic the new abilities that paul gets also feel too convenient and easy to get characters change a lot instantly jessica suddenly becomes this completely different character and same goes with paul i can see how it may have to be rushed in the movie format but the pacing couldve been better paul is the prophesied prophet and that just happens with no surprises etc in some ways i think that was for the better as it avoids the overdone struggling hero cliche but i was prepared to feel tense for paul but never really felt that there was a reason to feel tenseoverall its a solid it is a technical masterpiece if you look at cinematography etc but as a movie overall its just another good watch which is well worth its time and thats completely fine,positive
32,from the time this movie has been released it has been described as one of the best sequal ever madebut i feel bad to say this its notit is still a good movie but it is inferior to the first parti havent read the books and when i watched the first part it was so entertaining and when you know a director like denis villeneuev will also make the next partyour expectations increases multiple timesi can understand they have a book and they are making it according to the source material but still you dont feel that amazement or thrill like the first moviefor me the biggest reason is not hiring the writer of the first movie eric rothhe is a damn good writer and has written movies like forrest gumpthe curious case of benjamin button and etci dont know the reason why he wasnt there for this movie but surely thing might have been different if he was on boardthey changed the color palette also from the first movieit was a little bluish in the first part which suited it but here they changed it and it looks quite differentit goes on with slow story telling and becomes really fast paced in the last or minutesi am not saying its a bad movie but what you expect after watching the first part its not at that levelbehaviour of characters was also one dimensional and wasnt explored properly maybe because they had to fill so many things in hours of timeyou know extended version of hours would work for this movie because there is so much to add or explainbut as we know it would never come outrest actingmusic cinematography all are good like the first partyou will like it but after it will be over you will be left with a feeling of something missing out from itlets hope the next part would be much more thrilling than this onei believe in denis villeneuev and he is one of the best director of our time and i will watch whatever he will make,positive
33,as a scifi enthusiast i approached the latest dune movie with a sense of anticipation hoping to be swept away by its grandeur and depth however what i encountered left me feeling underwhelmed and disconnected the film seemed to lack the spark that ignites the imagination opting instead for a plodding pace that failed to engage me fullyperhaps it was my own weariness or a misalignment with the source material but i struggled to find moments worth revisiting after the credits rolled the supposed best scenes seemed to blur together in a haze of monotony leaving me searching for a standout moment or two to cling towhile i can appreciate the efforts of the filmmakers and the ambition behind bringing such a beloved story to life i cant help but feel that the overwhelming hype surrounding this adaptation is somewhat unwarranted despite its visual spectacle and starstudded cast dune left me yearning for a deeper connection and a stronger emotional resonance that simply wasnt presentin the end while the film may find its audience among diehard fans of the franchise or those with a particular affinity for its themes for me it fell short of the lofty expectations set by its predecessors and failed to leave a lasting impression,positive
34,if this movie wasnt hours long if it were say hours id probably give it a solid a lot went into this film and i could write a review full of things i liked but given all the of ratings making it possibly the most overrated hollywood film this century i just have to state the minusesdune part was full of long dialogue heavy scenes and too many characters and too much worship of timothe chalamets character paul we get it hes the chosen one it just came off as clich and zendaya is cool but shes not the caliber of actor that can hold a movie for hours she had rbf the entire moviealso the build up to the bad guys dying over the last two films was a big let down the uncle character baron was awful for films and he gets killed in seconds same with his nephew glossu all this time spent with them and they just fall over and die and christopher walken was terribly miscast in this as the emperor weak characterand the sandworms they were cool the first times but for the amount of screen time they get and they never change it gets old after awhileits a good film to revisit to fall asleep too but it other than a cool soundtrack and some great cinematography and costume design this film doesnt really do much dune has proven a very difficult story to capture on film and no one has done it right yet,positive
35,paul has to prove himself to both chani and the fremen his dreams become more vivid one path leads to destruction maybe even the loss of chanii dont think ive anticipated a film quite so much as this since being spellbound by the first i counted down the days for this follow up and by chance got to see it a day earlyin one single word captivating the best film ive seen in a very long time absolutely wonderful from start to finish the character development visuals music action sequences are all tremendouswe get to see paul growing before our very eyes the character at the end of the film is very different to the one at the start the best yet from chalamet he shows a degree of grita special mention about the performance of austin butler i thought he was incredibly good as feyd rauth what a menacing villain one of those that had you wondering about what hed do next and that makeup awesomei cant fault a single performance inspired casting backed up by a marvellous scriptthe music is spot on once again i instantly wanted to download ripples in the sand and pauls dream once againincredible visuals from the amazing location work to the creative camera work and the jaw dropping special effectsi thought this was going to be the toughest movie of the franchise as so much happens at the start and the finish it wasnt the case this was a fabulous movie,positive
36,here ill conflate both of villeneuves dunes within one critic it is a slow wide deep and bare opus best viewed on the biggest possible screen and sound system in typical villeneuve fashioni didnt read the books but i saw the movie and villeneuves version is built to become a classic even if less spectacular or outrageous what really hit the mark for me is austin butlers performance with his coarse voice and intense demeanor in fact the whole sequence on geidi prime was for me the best moment of the movies with the bleak oppressive lightning of a black sun sciencefiction at its bestalas one aspect lessened my pleasure and it is zendaya as chani i dont know why hollywood insist so much into giving her femme fatale roles but each and every time i didnt believe it instead of seing the character all i can see is the same rather plainlooking actress with her limited range maybe she just didnt found her niche yeton the other hand of the acting spectrum bautista is underrated as an actor here offering an emotional convincing performence in fact nearly all actors were very good up to par with the technical team those movies get better with every viewing a solid stars,positive
37,i couldnt see christopher walken as embodying a character in this i only saw christopher walken as christopher walkenand i might be the only person on earth who finds florence pugh to be the epitome and definition of bland they could have hired someone they found walking at a random mall to play irulanalso the movie feels like an episode more than the conclusion of a twopart movie i can only assume that is to set up a continuation of the dune novels so if the pacing and climax and ending all feel wonky to you that is the best explanation i can give to you in your time of cinematic needotherwise the film is entertaining for its length lots of good cinematography music etc,positive
38,movie is so good that i went back to theater next day for watch it again i have never done this before i have never watched any movie twice in theateri just couldnt get enough of this film and it feels like i need to go watch it rd time visuals and sounds are stunning cast is so good that i cant ask any better performance the whole dune universe is magical intriguing captivating and thrilling if you are fan of science fictions and good lore with deep detailed story behind it this movie is a love letter for youabsolutely amazing film this is my all time number movie i have ever seen in my years old age on this planet,positive
39,i had the joy of watching this movie early and was nothing short of amazed simply put this movie is one of the best crafted and most impressive films i have ever seen the casting is spectacular and the massive character arcs that are displayed masterfully are as well the camera angles are creative and unique showcasing multiple landscapes in fascinating new ways even surpassing the quality of dune part one this movie gave me the chills often and was reminiscent of the original three star wars movies in a way both franchises paved the way for something entirely new and showcase revolutionary film techniques that are sure to dazzle and inspire audiences for years to come this movie was one of the best i have ever seen and i highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to sit through a three hour long movie,positive
40,frank herberts dune is widely considered to be some of the most challenging science fiction material to adapt to the big screen in villeneuve hit it out of the park with dune part one in part two he outdoes himself in every way from cinematography to music to choreography to acting and dialogue this movie had a mountain to climb to prove itself and it didwith hans zimmer composing the score it should surprise no one how well it compliments the film greig fraser dune part one the creator the batman was at the helm of cinematography and really took my breath away with the magnificent vistas incredible use of colours and even infrared and expert capture of motion and scale fraser explains that they shot in digital transposed to mm then back to digital this seemed absurd to me until he explained that digital appeared too crisp for audiences and film too nostalgic his method obtained the perfect balance i cant fault him for that because i agreethe real risk here is of course the adaptation how to retain some of the richest and most beloved science fiction lore in existence and condense it into the hours and minutes runtime villeneuve took a huge risk by splitting the first book into two parts had studios not greenlit part two we would have been left with half a book unsatisfying for everyone thankfully the gamble paid off and he was able to tell the epic story across two movies bordering on three hours even this required a brisk pace with many notable scenes omitted despite this i think villeneuve retained the heart and soul of the story he created two movies which appeal to both general audiences and fans alike there is so much to love here that i cant imagine anyone walking away feeling unsatisfied with the price of entrysee this on the biggest screen you can find then see it again the visuals and score demand it you will not be disappointed,positive
41,i mean yeah its very entertaining and of course very visually stunning the set pieces the cinematography the use of visual effects and lights the sound design and music all absolutely amazing and almost literally stunningbut then im not really seeing much after that as i have not read the books this movie was a total mystery to me theres barely any dialogat least not any that would explain anything whats going on at all the world and the technology etc just doesnt make much sense to menone of the characters are particularly interesting to be honest they dont really have that much personality to them and even if they did they didnt really make me care about them all that muchi dont know im a bit conflicted it wasnt a bad movie and as i said it was entertaining and visually mesmerizing but it lacked the depth that i was expecting of a world this size and this rich with lore and history maybe the movie makers assumed everyone has read the books as someone to who the world is not familiar at all it just seems rather confusing and strange i feel like they just focused on making it as visually awesome as they can in which they arguably succeeded but left the story on the pages of the books,positive
42,i just watched the prepremiere of part two of dune it was a very good adaption of the books but not what totally what i expected at the end the movie strayed away from the book which made me a bit sad to be honest especially the part which is very important in the bookstoryline is the fact that the sister of paul wasnt born yet when the film came to its conclusion where in the book his little sister kills the baron in the film paul takes the honor of doing so also the fact that chani is not supporting paul for taking the hand of the emperors daughter didnt have a child with him yet and actually goes her own way makes it hard to get a good start for the inevitable third movie that has to come as a movie it was a great experience though the action is great and the storytelling just as well i personally wished that they sticked to the book till the end part one definitely did follow the book part two also till the midst of the film still i strongly recommend to watch it it is a mustsee movie and ranks as one of my alltime favorites already,positive
43,i havent seen the first chalamet dune but i have seen the david lynch one and personally think its so much better i think the cinematography was beautiful in dpt the acting was great the accuracy to the books but i was so bored it makes me wonder what the goal of making these movies besides money duh was a modern interpretation of dune a deep dive into the character dynamics a story that would be better appreciated with improved cgi beats memy opinion might be controversial but despite being a wellmade movie i just dont think its that remarkable lynchs dune was bizarre had that beloved retro scifi vibe way more memorable character designs and just left more of an impression on me accuracy between books and their movies is also a divisive topic but unless the author is making the movie themself why expect perfect duplicationmy recommendation unless youre a diehard dune fan you can definitely skip this one,positive
44,this second part of the movie sets the tone much in the same way as the first movie making the movie feels like cramming alot of story and backdrop in a way too small time frame which is logical considering dune spans several novels with a history of years of civilization villeneuve however put more focus on aesthetics rather than storytelling which makes the movie a bland and confusing thing to watch the pacing is irregular at some parts dragging alot and towards the end you get the feeling that it is rapping it up in a unsatisfying speed especially for people who are not familiair with the original material you dont get the sense what the backstories are of the characters and why they made the decisions they made cramming a story like dune in a two part sets of films is probably not doing the story justice should have been remade into an tv series to make it really work therefore the rewatchability of this rendition of dune is very unlikely,positive
45,it is probably impossible to create a good dune movie as the books are really complex in many ways with that said the first movie captured the essence of dune as well as you could and kept true to the plot for the most partthis second movie however kills some characters and dynamics why is stilgar only a comedic relief why did they decide to leave alia one of the most important characters in the books out of the movie why is the relationship between chani and paul so shallow they even left out that they had a son that died the ending scene is underwhelming and is not in line with paul from the booksif youre willing to ignore these issues or you have never read the books at all this is still a great movie but the authentic dune experience still remains frank herberts book,positive
46,before you call dune part ii the best scifi movie or even just a masterpiece try and consider the bullet points ive made below you might even end up agreeing with some of them beforhand let me just point out that the movie was extraordinary beautifully filmed with goosebumpy music added to a dozen of memorable shots hence the good rating so yeah it is a great movie with great acting its actually a really good movie but that has been pointed out by a lot of people already let me tell why this isnt in the league the major problem pacing parts of the movie which could have been legendary ended up being rushed the battle of the sardaukar and fremen and pauls first time riding the wormmetroyou dont have to be a criticizer of the movie to admit that the last fight with fremen and sardaukar was so shy of what it could have been the fremen just sweeps away the emperors army i mean come on in around minutes of screentime this is what the whole movie leads up to minutes and not nailbittering minutes with an epic battle just minutes of one side slaughtering the other i get that they took them by surprise but please it would have added film value to get a tense fight where you actually wonder whether or not they will succeed instead of getting a edgeofyourseat moment we got the predictable outcome it feels like denis was told to compress the last of the film making it as anticlimactic as possiblethe sandwormride did make a good scene but you dont actually see any training whatsoever so instead of getting psyched up by him succeeding you end up thinking could he do this all the time pauls metamorphose to become the chosen one or rather the absence of it why cant this guy admit that there might be something to the prophecy i get that his humility is what makes him adequate for the part but because of his continuing denial of the prophecy we as audience too lose faith in him as the kwisatz haderach which just like the incident of him learning to sandwormride makes an unfulfilling anticlimactic and awkward transition the weak villains i was expecting a lot from the villainside after dune where the emperor and baron felt clever and sly feyd had a great portrayal in the movie though but the rest of them seemed frivolous seriously how did the emperor manage to keep his throne for that long with an army that with a little surprise breaks like glass and rabban is apparently just a joke despite him actually being sort of scary in dune in general the harkonnens seem off by a lot they get toyed around on multiple occasions and we in the audience never actually see them as a threat due to their weak portrayal we mostly see them kill poor employees chani and paul had zero romance sorry but its true i want to see them as this meanttobe couple but we literally only see them bonding a couple of times i made the assumption that chani must be bipolar the girl is crazy careful and suspicious of other people several times in the movie but starts a relationship with paul based on scenes with interaction people on tinder tend to talk more with each other before jumping into bed than these two the political aspect or once again the absence of the same we hear about these other houses as dangerous and powerful but where are they as a viewer who hasnt read the books i do not have the slightest idea of what these other houses are capable of this is probably the main reason of the incomplexity of the plot we dont any political reflections or responses despite the fact that it must mean a great deal without the tangled political game which i guess is pretty damn important in a world run by houses the plot becomes predictable on a level which compares to most superheromoviesimagine that we had seen the other houses and their beautiful planets now that would be scifi in its gloryconsider that i had so much against the storytelling which is the fundamental part of a film yet still gave it im surely also going to see it in theaters at least one more time that goes to show how brilliant the cinematography actually was worth watching not praising,positive
47,great movies should always leave you with a feeling during or after seeing themwhile this movie is being hailed as a masterpiece by many i felt that it didnt give me the feeling of chills that dune part made feel multiple timesthose who say that it is the greatest scifi movie ever made should be arrested at oncethis movie had all the ingredients to actually be a modern day masterpiece but it feels like dennis was a bit restraint to go all the way as if he could not dare to be free and do things he could have done with the story and actionthat being said dune part is an amazing movie and i will see it againhowever while ive seen the part more than times i dont think part will have that effect on metime will tell,positive
48,i have said that denis villeneuve is a master of putting grand spectacle on screen dune part was an outsized enhancement of its predecessor seeing it in imax helped bring the massive landscape of this film into scope for the viewergreig fraser is a master cinematographer the camera work coupled with the special effects have created a world that evokes a visceral feeling of realismthe stunning visuals were accompanied with a beautiful score to guide emotions and tactful sound design that was vociferous in nature but also withdrawn when it needed to be believable choreography acting to boota starstudded cast that never outshines their characters only once i kind of got taken out of the movie by a character and it was because of weird line delivery the story was drawn out but never felt like it was dragginga fantastic experience with a crowd another cinematic achievement to add to denis filmography that will surely bring him more awardsps javier bardem was having a time with his role austin butler showed off his range as an actor also loved the surprise cameo from an actress who is starring in another big movie this yearpss can i make ride the worm a commonly used phrase without it being misconstrued as dirtythis is a clear early oscar candidate for best visual effects best sound design best editing best picture best director best cinematography best production design best costume design and best scorepotential in acting categories as well,positive
49,the true beauty of denis villeneuves dune films is that if you havent read the books which most viewers havent you still get a true sense of the scope of the materialits epic massive and its on full display in these gorgeous films tragedy horror and honorthe director and writers have done a great service to us allthese are incredible films films that this ignorant generation who undoubtebly have no idea of its importance claim their own defining an era much like star wars did in the s this will set the standard all epic films from this point forward will be judged accordingly,positive
50,i was only mildly impressed with dune it was a huge improvement over david lynchs s version thats for sure but it was also very slow and showed little in the way of characters and personalities it was bigbut also a bit disappointing despite this bigness fortunately this second film while also slow is a bit more interesting to watch and its battle scenes must have been truly amazing to watch on the big screen and fortunately it also gives does a bit more in making a few of the major characters more fully fleshed out an interesting while not a perfect version of the second portion of the frank herbert book it is very good and well worth seeingmy only regrets about the film were minimal first the worm scenes were far less interesting than id hoped as you barely see them and they only come partially out of the ground also i had to laugh at how many of the battles involved swordsin a scifi epic so many swordswhen a machine gun or tank would have been so much better still these are very minor quibbles and the film is well worth your timei might say more but there are well over reviews so nuff said,positive
51,i saw dune on an xd screen and sound system visually dune was jaw dropping the sound was intense and at times too loud and droning if you are interested in seeing this movie it is worth seeing on a big screenthough i was fully engaged for its hour and minute run time i would not call dune a masterpiece most characters acted emotionally flat i also felt the romance between paul and chani was not convincing when the story was reaching its climax i did not care about the characters i also think the movie should have spent a little time on setup about the fremen i get that they are oppressed by the harkonnen but their sacrifices and lost freedom should be shown to the viewer so we understand the emotional motivation to do a full assault on the harkonnenaustin butler was so intense in the movie it illustrates his acting range i hope he is recognized for his performanceand here are some little nitpicky criticisms they dont address how the fremen eat in terms of world building these sort of details are necessary to make the world believable im not convinced humans could survive on arrakis there is no way you could grow crops and raise animals did they eat synthetic food the planet also couldnt sustain gigantic worms these huge beasts would have to consume millions of calories a day which is not available showing the details of a sustainable life on such a dry planet would help with believability and the voice control thing done by the bene gesserit is sort of dumb i know this is from the book but that part of the book doesnt hold up over time,positive
52,honestly this is the first time i went to watch a movie times in theaters and i dont regret any time i went to see this movie its jist so beautifully put together words cannot describe how i feel about this movie you feel everything in this movie sad satisfied or excited and even more throughout this movie dv unlocked the feeling of goosebumps and crying for the people who didnt experience this when watching a movie that speech and ending had me have insane amount of goosebumps and tears especially with that hans zimmer score its one of the best scores in movies ever its hanss best work so far i feel like each song stuck to a title being desert spring i felt goosebumps with any score this movie showed how you introduce a villain you do not go just saying oh no a new threat is coming i need to get superman to get himyou should definitely go to an imax dolby cinema to go watch this you can see how dv made this especially for imax with the whole movie being shot with imax digital cameras the cinematography done in this is excellent acting done was also incredible with timothee chalamet and javier bardem zendaya on the other hand can feel a little bit weird as in the book she wasnt this rebel but i can understand how dv makes zendaya like this because frank herbert wanted paul to be an antihero but changing the script a bit can fully convey the message of paul being an antiherooverall i want to watch this again as soon as it comes back in imax for the third time but i will look for imax gt to get the full immersive experience of imax i do not want to watch this online because the immersive experience of dune will be gone as the screen is just too small even though i have dts sound system at home this makes star wars sequels look like trash i hope dv will make messiah be even better and try and make alia look like an abomination,positive
53,i want to love this movie despite being in a confused state throughout the film i enjoyed what i was seeing visually the lack of dialogue didnt work for me although its an aspect that would lessen the more i learned about the characters and world i just dont get much of a chance at that within the movie despite my uninvolvement of the dune world and its characters i still have to be honest with the faults of the script and editingother than the overarching plot scenes happen rather than you being lead into scenes via an emotional journey the first hour is a back and forth of random tests and does she like him or not many characters simply appear in the movie some deep into the runtime including a main villain who has no discernible traits other than evil for the sake of it some characters appear very briefly and dont do much at all the motivation of everyone was stripped out of the script we see an abundant amount of screen time on someone riding a worm but large battles will abrubtly end after very little setup did we need a large segment of screen time involving the nukes when we couldve just been told that theres nukes the nuke scene feels as a standout filler sequence perhaps to be overshadow a few dozen moments of filler that couldve been replaced with ploti would challenge the praisers of this film to explain why everything was perfect austin butlers character was great why because he was so one dimensional the battles are the best you mean snippets of battles that we got and one where it was hard to tell who was who the score was amazing oh the unbelievably overused bong noise that will randomly appear in the most tepid of scenes even the twist ending was foreshadowed in the first few minutes this film is all spectacle with no emotional payoff the number one praise that people will use to describe greatness of dune is the cinematography this should be a leg that a great movie stands on not the foundation although the direction and technicality of the look of dune is epic the writing and editing are faulty maybe upon rewatches i would like it more since i might understand more of the details after getting those details from other sources but its still nowhere as good as it could be or as most everyone seems to think it is,positive
54,so look dune part by denis vilneuve was pretty decent id give that one a ish but part was really pretty boring and lacked all of the gravitas you had in the first movieeveryone in the movie is incredibly serious and every word they speak is extended by long close ups of their faces its really drab and in the end i really didnt care about any of the characters it was just scene after scene of people saying really serious stuff that ultimately is not believable or particularly deepthe music is faux epic and sadly doesnt lend any particular weight to whats ultimately a decent story told in a very boring wayid say the vfx is good yeah not bad but the costumes and the battle scenes are also boring like going through the motionsthe film has a few good moments but an epic scifi masterpiece of our time this film is not the silly desert walks are pretty funny though xd haha,negative
55,i cried the last few minutes of pure explosion of stimuli cinema understanding the spectacle as few filmmakers understand today a film that i have to process to begin trying to break down but that at first impression i simply have to surrender to that confession that it captivated me through the senses to the point of tears as i would expect from this type of cinema which in the last years has fallen and there is no bottom to its decline i was captured by the sound by the most crystalline screen i have ever experienced and since the guttural sound of the opening shook my stomach i didnt think about anything else for almost hours i was not a child enjoying it i was an adult surrendering to the experience one that i assure you was a first years of theaters and dune made me feel like the first time again,positive
56,denis villeneuve obviously takes dune very seriously as it peaks up right where part one left off we remain with acts thats left of what i refer to as the dune duo a part is of course necessary but until we get one its a duo and then it fits perfectly part one is acts of the story and were left with a dazzling display of intensityhans zimmer continues what he many times referred to as a project that is really close to him and it shows after releasing additional albums full of almost hours of music besides the official dune part one soundtrack he continues his quest for the true soul of dune in my opinion the musicwhich leads me to my next point you have to watch it in imax it will blow you away my popcorn box was literally vibrated by the bass and some parts of the film were so visually stunning that i was quite literally jaw droppedwithout giving anything away dune part is just magnificent,positive
57,well it certainly seems that this film has produced a whole array of memes within the couple of weeks since it was released in the cinemas it is almost as if this film has quickly become a cultural phenomena like its a pretty good film even if only because of the cinematography which was absolutely fantastic though having grown up on a steady diet of lynchs version i do find myself always comparing this film with that one i have read the book but it was ages ago it also means that im pretty familiar with the storythe problem is that there were a number of divergences from the book for instance it appears that the time that the events take place have been compressed from three years to one which means that alia isnt born which also means that she doesnt kill the baron either then there is the whole thing about there being two factions one that is secular and one that is fanatical and it turns out that chani is from the secular one which leads to an interesting endingthen again i suspect that the creators assume that most of the audience dont actually know the story like im only familiar with it up to the end of the first book but the film did end on a cliffhanger suggesting that there is more to come something that didnt seem to be the case with the lynch version though there is another version that also includes dune messiah and children of duneas i mentioned it was a pretty good film especially the cinematography that was amazing however my main gripe would be that it felt as if the film ended a bit too quickly which i have to say is odd for a film that happens to be two and a half hours long actually that was even more strange considering that the battle in the first film seemed to take up half of the film so i was expecting that the battle here would take about as much time though it didnt also there didnt seem to be much mention of the wierding way though it wasnt ignored it was just that lynch changed it in his film because i didnt want to do kungfu on sand dunesanyway yeah its certainly worth watching and despite it being a pretty long film it did keep me hooked right through to the end,positive
58,dune part two directed by the masterful denis villeneuve stands as a remarkable sequel that not only lives up to but surpasses its predecessor much like the celebrated sequels the fellowship of the ring the dark knight and the bourne ultimatum this film elevates the franchise to new heightsvilleneuves atmospheric and deliberately paced direction complemented by hans zimmers enigmatic score creates an immersive experience that captivates from the very beginning the vast sweeping dunes of sand and the breathtaking scenes of giantworm riding traverse the expansive desert landscape leaving audiences mesmerized throughoutthe introduction of austin butler as feydrautha adds a compelling layer of malevolence while the demise of the harkonnen leader is satisfyingly intricate avoiding simplicity the film culminates in an epic duel between paul atreides and feydrautha delivering an elegantly crafted and thrilling conclusiontimothe chalamets performance as paul atreides the prophesied lisan algaib is nothing short of extraordinary his portrayal of the chosen leader is so captivating that it becomes impossible to look away from the screen the narrative remains faithful to frank herberts novel capturing the essence of the epic tale while hinting that the war has just begunwhile the novel doesnt extend to a part three the expansive universe of dune offers numerous sequels in the books with the right efforts and approvals there is hope for more cinematic adaptations in the future for now dune part two is a monumental achievement that demands to be seen and i eagerly anticipate experiencing it again this time with my beloved by my side,positive
59,tightly written well acted focused saga story the writing is without a wasted scene the acting fulfills the purpose of the story while none of the actors will win any acting awards the overall product makes this lengthy movie flyby and leave you wanting more well donethe story succeeds despite the fact that the characters are functionaries in the goal of the story none of them are well drawn and multidimensional apart from this the nuance of the purpose of the story drives you in and makes you care about themthere is satisfaction when the evil people get there just desserts you feel great when characters are reunited you feel sorrow when there are emotional defeats feel is the main message here the spectacle delivers,positive
60,denis villeneuve never fails to amaze on how beautiful his movies look and this one is no exceptionof course it has more action than the first one cause is the full on development of the anti heros journey of paul muaddib atreides therefore it showcases more depth and details plus good plot twists that justifies the journey and conflictbut also by having more storylines the pace and edition style feels rushed in some moments the storytelling with its halfexplained moments and all of a sudden time jumps doesnt gives the same fluidity that the first one hadthere are several backstories that needed more buildup or evidence to be believable or else less cutting out details from the book even though that means longer movies and more fast furious type of movie fans complaining about way too long moviesof course the ending is grandiloquent as a space opera like dune should be but the first two acts of the movie could have been better not in its photography music or overall production value which are amazing just in the telling of a story that evidently has a lot of branches that needed more room to grow,positive
61,denis villeneuves dune part two is a reviewproof film either you watched and loved the first part in which case you have already gone out and seen it oryou didnt like the first part or didnt watch it in which case you are not going to the cineplex to check out the sequelif you are going to see this film the bankofmarquis strongly recommends you see it in theaters with the best sound and largest screen possiblefor reasonsreason this film is visually and audibly stunning it is a feast for the eyes and ears director villeneuve and all involved in the production costume sound and fx design have topped the very high bar they set for themselves with the first dune and expect this film to rake in all of these types of awards come next oscars season they visually and audibly credibly present new worlds in such a way that you are sure that the movie was filmed on location when in fact it is all pretty much green sky an amazing technical achievementreason its a good thing that this film is visually and audibly stunning because the storyline itself is rather boring and somewhat complex this is the fault of the source novel as dune and its sequels are just as interested in the politics and back room dealings of how you turn a hero into a messiah with a ton of backstory and plot development thought by the characters never a good way to present a movie so you will want to watch this in a theater so you can keep focused on the plot as opposed to at home where you will be tempted to pick up your phone pet the dog go make a sandwich etc and not miss some of the intricaciescaught between reason and reason are a laundry list of performers and performances that are struggling to match the technical achievements of dune part two while acting against a green screen with some long boring speeches and some very clunky dialoguetimothee chalamet zendaya rebecca ferguson and charlotte rampling all return from the first part and they are just fine not really elevating things but not bringing them down either they gamely bring their best to a rather difficult and thankless jobthank goodness javier bardem and josh brolin are back as their characters bring some life and energy to the proceedings while florence pugh dave bautista lea seydoux stellan skarsgard and especially christopher walken are wasted in their roles really being more of a piece of furniture to move around rather than anything that represents an interesting characteronly austin butlers feydrautha brings new excitement to the nd half of this hour and minute epic and by that point in this film it is much neededcome to dune part two for the visual and sound achievements and stay forthe visual and sound achievements and the setup to the inevitable sequelletter grade b stars out of and you can take that to the bankofmarquis,positive
62,this is a fantastic film to me it was almost perfect acting is fantastic and the visuals are outofthisworld i was enthralled throughout my whole time in the cinema i happily saw it twice and wish id taken the time to see it a third time as i never saw it in imax it was the best cinema experience ive ever had and i fully believe that you will love it tooif anyone else enjoys timothee chalamets acting i would also recommend the king he was great in that as henry v and im sure his performance contributed to his casting in dune however i can see why some people were frustrated by the plot having never read the book i dont know the full extent of the changes but i do understand that it was deemed unfilmable back in when the first attempt was released which reminds me a bit of a serious take on flash gordon or something anyway this as well as part are very streamlined it feels fastpaced and eventful which i really enjoyed as i didnt need everything the worldbuilding was enough but if you are looking for a faithful adaptation this might not be what you are looking for i dont knowi guess one issue i had was that the discussion of paul as the lisanalgaib reminded me of the discussion of brian as the messiah in life of brian which i personally found to be hilarious and it felt like a deliberate homage as the actors seemed to find it funny when they were speaking the lines but it did take me out of the story a little when i watched it at homefinally when i saw this at home on the small screen i really enjoyed it however it was simply not the same all of the visuals were limited by comparison and while i refer to it as the small screen this was on a relatively large screen i own a projector that was probably projecting somewhere around as a result while i will advise that you see this film in any format that is available to you but if you can keep an eye on any cinema imax rereleases you will not regret it it was simply amazing on the big screensaying this it is still my favourite film of by far,positive
63,this movie is visually well done for of it shot in the bright sun of a desert the sound is also great but i wouldnt call it music so much as tones it fits though more like something seen in a tv show then the epic music that danny elfman or john williams bringthe writers really didnt read the books did they like the first film but even worse this was a childs cliff notes version of the actually books to know the storyline youd have to have read the books or watched the previous superior versions chani is especially poorly done and again the characters are mostly just long gazesi understand the simpletons who enjoyed the visuals this movie has made a good deal of money but theres a reason it wont ever reach a billion mark like truly epic films and the imdb meter on this will probably drop closer to my score as nonfanatics see this film over the coming years again the part frank herbert miniseries is the best the is the classic nostalgia and this one looks pretty but says very little,positive
64,both films are pretty consistent in the sense of they both look amazing the sound and score is top tier hans zimmer the action sequences are good when they actually happen which is not very often the actors are all good actors but theyre both just straight up boring films to the corei dont understand how people write reviews calling it masterpiece or the peak of film making i just dont believe they could actually be entertained by the straight up dead story and dead dialogue for what seemed for the whole movie the only piece of dialogue i actually remember being somewhat entertaining was when timothy chalamet said to josh brolin i recognise your footsteps im not missing anything im sure it was justnothing i couldnt wait for it to endit just seems to me people are lying because they want to seem smart because this was an acclaimed novel and had been made into a movie before in the past or theyre just timothy chalamet groupies im a big fan of him as an actor in his other work and just want him to do well i refuse to believe anyone found the plot of this movie good thus making it entertaining and its not like it made up for the lack of story with amazing story telling through action like mad max fury road did can anyone think of any other reasons why people would really rate this movie even close to a,positive
65,dune part and dune part are films that define what scifi should be an epic with a grand scale and an incredible storyi love herberts novel and until villeneuves films i believed that this was the type of story that could not be translated into a picture jesus how wrong i was its an absolute masterpiece and something that lives in you some may be turned off by the fact that the entire film is based mainly on dialogues and building relationships but i am sure that for those few including myself it will be a masterpiece on par with star wars for our fathers this is what genre cinema should look like not robots saving the galaxy and women in tight leggings jumping on buildings yes im talking about you marvelthe best movie ive seen in many many many years,positive
66,a real movie captivates through compelling storytelling strong character development and immersive visuals and sound it transcends mere entertainment to evoke emotions provoke thought and resonate with audiences on a deeper level today cinema needs to balance innovation with tradition blending advanced technology like cgi with strong narrative substance to meet audience expectations modern viewers seek originality relatability and escapism dune part two is highly anticipated because it promises a continuation of an epic saga with rich worldbuilding intricate plots and high production values fulfilling the desire for both spectacle and meaningful content,positive
67,the ending really ruined the film for me the strong love and relation between paul and chani is lost love which is very clearly seen in the whole first books giving chani a bigger role was ok but not at the expense of breaking the love between them having read the first book a few times and having seen the s movie and s tv series i will only say this it ruined the whole movie for mei did expect some changes and different artistic views but this was way too muchexcept one time where was pauls bene gesserit training in the whole movie which by the way helped him overcome a lot in his journey,positive
68,dune part two is a film by denis villeneuve from dune part two tells the story of the mythical journey of paul atreides who with the help of chani and the fremen embarks on a campaign of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family young paul is faced with the choice between the love of his life and the fate of the entire universe but he must try by all means to prevent a terrible future a future that no one but him can foreseedenis villeneuve returns with extremely impressive images dune part two is a monumental film that largely rejects the usual blockbuster spectacle and instead reflects almost contemplatively on power and domination this longawaited film is therefore a multilayered commentary on our geopolitical present in which the voices of reason are hardly heard anymore villeneuve leads us to a dead end or rather we suddenly slide into an abyss and it is no longer so easy to determine how this could have happened,positive
69,dune part is an exceptional continuation of the epic saga that left audiences eagerly anticipating more from the very start the film captivates with its breathtaking visuals and intricate storytelling transporting viewers to the mystical and dangerous world of arrakisthe plot is filled with intense moments and unexpected twists keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout the character development is deep and compelling with performances that bring depth and nuance to the iconic figures of the dune universeone of the standout elements of dune part is its otherworldly soundtrack the music composed by hans zimmer perfectly complements the grand scale of the film enhancing the emotional and dramatic impact of each scene its a sonic experience that lingers long after the credits rolloverall dune part is a cinematic triumph its a masterful blend of action drama and science fiction delivering an immersive and unforgettable experience whether youre a longtime fan of the series or new to the dune universe this film is a mustwatch,positive
70,just got out of the early access screening and all i can say is wow truly blew my mind from start to finish the film keeps the foot on the gas peddle and doesnt allow you to breath even for a secondthe arena has got to be one of my favourite scenes in any movie the cinematography colour score and performance by butler is truly a sight to beholdoutstanding performances by timothe and butler with timothe showing his range throughout the course of the movie morphing into the thing he tries to avoid the most and butler playing the psychopath amazingly well one you want to see in imax memorable experience,positive
71,i really liked dune part one so much so i saw it three times in the theater and twice streaming i was really looking forward to part two aw it last night and it was a bit of a disappointment for mei felt that this movie relied way more heavily on loud special effects like explosions and fire power than the character exploration of part one saw this is dolby cinema sometimes the music and the sound track was louder than the actors and it was hard to hear what they were saying it made it hard to follow what was happeningand then there were a couple of other things the stilgar character was reduced to a fanatical buffoon it seemed out of character from how bardem delivered him in part oneand oh how about zendaya if this was the first time i saw her on screen id say keep your day job for some reason her character was reduced to literally one facial expression the entire hours and minutes it was bizarredont get me wrong however i still liked the movies and there were some scene that were truly top notch i just think part one is measurably better,positive
72,imax is definitely the way to see this its a big loud more actionfocused installment i loved part one and was so excited for this that i couldnt help but be disappointed by multiple aspectsthe editing was jarring at times a scene would suddenly end and the next scene is a completely different setting apparently at some future but unknown date this occurs multiple timesthe baron and to a lessor extent rabban are dramatically reduced as characters in part i know he was poisoned but the baron was a terrifying figure in part and is barely even a threat in part austin butler is great but hes hardly in the movieall the talk of messiah and holy war are repeated many times but i was never sold on it pauls refusal to venture south for so long felt more annoying than earned im sure the book does a much better job but this is the movie also i couldnt help but laugh every time jessica said her daughter a fetus was asking questionseverything else was great its a true epic im just one of the few that slightly preferred part one,positive
73,dune part two is definitely an entertaining movie but as it stands as an lets dial it back a bit the movie itself visually is a masterpiece but my problem stems from character development and plot rushing to me it seems like the last half of the movie was supposed to be hours long itself but the whole movie itself was cut under hours the climactic finish to the film was super fast and felt like the stakes were low because it just went from one thing to the next with no time to breathe also pauls attraites or how ever you spell it his character pulls a game of thrones esque queem of dragons vibe where there goals and personality are one thing then dramatically shift seemingly out of no where overall it was a good film a bit long for my taste but its worth a watch if you like sci fi,positive
74,you would expect a dramatization of this calibre to paint a picture with all the colors of the original story the ambient backstory of an interstellar empire the role of the spice as the only way to traverse the vast space between the planets the intricate politics around the control of it the infinite double helix of plans within plans the clash of civilizations and prophecies the mutual development of the characters within the story the specter of philosophies and their cradleswell if you did you were dead wrongall you get is some sturmunddrang cgi somewhat fancy panoramas backed by the same old supposedly dramatic thirdgrade middle easternish cheesy flutechants fashion channel panning shots of models in unnatural poses and well no and thats about itthe acting is pathetic for the most part an otherwise fantastic cast of legendary actors were put to reciting stiff dialogue barely hiding their confusionfull of sound and fury signifying nothing,positive
75,this movie grabs you by the throat from the very first and keeps you engaged throughout the visuals are stunning and there is finally a little i mean a little more time spent developing plot lines in a more digestible format in the first dune characters appeared and disappeared so quickly that you really didnt care what happened to them dune is very long but i guess thats a given with such a dense storywhat is missing is any true connection made with the characters there is no exploration of pauls inner thoughts or struggles or conflicts hes just always the hero the love story doesnt develop it just happens and zendaya basically just scowls or looks confused throughout the movie also there is so much crammed into the movie that there were plot leaps that werent fully explained so that diminishes your full investment you just let the visuals and spectacle roll over you to be a successful movie doesnt mean that every book element needs to be included editing would have created a more wellrounded and emotionally impactful flicki do recommend as a spectacle and fascinating other world creation but great it is not in other aspects,positive

78,austin butler sheds his elvis accent while timothee chalamet continues to sharpen his jawline as the fremens messiahdune part two is an absolute scifi masterpiece director denis villeneuve expertly builds upon the solid foundation laid by the first film injecting politics religion and romancethe acting here is fantastic with standouts being austin butler who is psychotic and creepy as feydrautha along with rebecca ferguson who takes on something totally different than the last films characterization of lady jessicagreig fraser is also a standout as the cinematographer along with the entire vfx team this group is incredibly talented using a very limited color palette to create stunningly realistic sandworms spaceships and otherworldly armiesthe sound mixing department and hans zimmers score also work hand in hand to create an oddly pleasing yet deafening imax theater experience this film is so loud and grandi also respect how denis villeneuve is sticking to his guns that he had while filming sicario he doesnt want to glorify the violence as he wants to show its effects on its victims while the film is visually stunning the violence is what it is its brutal and not over the topoverall dune showcases the best scifi has to offer with a great adaptation of frank herberts space drama created with top tier acting and production,positive
79,for one of the many book readers all i have to say is wow ive read a lot of books that utterly fail in adapting the book but denis adapts dune perfectly this is a scifi epic masterpiece i know people who have not read the book and they are absolutely in love with part what makes apart so amazing is how great of a job denis did with part the perfect set up movie for the ultimate showdown and the growth of a boy into a man and from a man into a messiah chalamet does a superb job in growing not only as an actor but as man becoming himself and learning the ways of the world please go see part as quickly as possible and in imax this movie deserves to go down as one of if not the greatest scifi movie of all time imax imax imax,positive
80,dune is a cinematic wonder to the world it has a perfect way just like dune to show worlds without to any color and yet show so much color at the same time now the holy war beginsthis is my humble opinion expresses trough aidune is a cinematic marvel that captivates with stunning visuals and a gripping story like the first movie it shows vast barren worlds that seem colorless but are filled with vivid details the film dives into the holy war raising the stakes and intensity each scene is beautifully crafted pulling viewers into the epic saga the performances are strong the music is haunting and the direction is visionary dune not only meets the high expectations set by the first film but also expands the universe in exciting and profound ways,positive
81,dune is a big screen actionadventure spectacle the likes of which hasnt been seen since well maybe the first dune in but when it comes to paying off what the original effort set up so perfectly this sophomore sequel doesnt quite hit it out of the parkfor a very basic overview dune picks up with paul timothee chalamet and mother jessica rebecca ferguson living amongst the fremen after house atreides being all but wiped out in the house harkonnen collaboration with the emperors army to retake arrakis though jessica and stilgar javier bardem continue to tout paul as the mythical prophesized messiah per the bene gesserit religious sect paul isnt yet convincednor are other fremen like chani zendaya will paul accept the mantle and risk allout religious waror choose to remain embedded locally with the fremen meanwhile baron harkonnen stellan skarsgard is struggling to control spice production on arrakis so unhinged nephew feydrautha austin butler is called in for assistance finally the emperor christopher walken and princess irulan florence pugh scheme to keep themselves in power over all of the machinationsthere is absolutely no doubt that dune is cinema spectacle of the highest order director denis villeneuve composes a film that should be seen in the biggest format possible to truly appreciate the scale and within the best sound structure dolby atmos for me and it was theaterrumbling there is never a dull moment from beginning to endalways something interesting to look at or immerse yourself in on screenheres the issue with dune the first film was one of the best worldbuilding setups ive ever seen in a flick it expertly dropped viewers into the planetary conflict gradually built up the key characters and imbued it all with a sense of great mystery and intrigue while this sequel technically pays off all those setups it doesnt always do so in the most satisfying or understandable of ways i wont go into every nook and cranny here but a few examplespaul resists his messianic calling the entire filmuntil the end when he just gives inthe fetus within jessica is talking to her and will someday grow up to be anya taylorjoys brief cameo charactereven after paul accepts his mantlethe houses wont acknowledge himthe bombshell of pauls morediversethanwerealized bloodline came off as anticlimactic especially considering how it immediately becomes the driving force of the films endgamei know that there is an answer to every question posed abovebut none of it felt all that satisfactory or revelatory to me part of the problem could be that i was expecting more of a definitive ending and received a setting up a franchise denouement instead a particularly telling observation was how my favorite character in the entire movie was butlers feydrautha why becauselike in dune it was something completely differentnew and shrouded in mystery that villeneuve was able to unwindso in my final reckoning of dune the visual spectacle and starstudded cast do most of the heavylifting if you dont see this one from a theater seat at least once you are doing yourself a disservice but if you are looking for a plottight perfectly characterfulfilling narrative you may walk away a little disappointed at least compared to the first villeneuve dune,positive
82,this movie was a masterpiece its a word requirement for this review so i will say this film had me feel the same vibes you get when you watch the very first matrix worm scene was incredible building up feyd rautha character was done so well excited for a rd but it will be hard to imagine how it can be better than this part two which was head shoulders better than part one action was non stop once again shout out to the greatest movie soundtrack composer of all time hans zimmer he is a national treasure if you have a favourite movie that comes to mind hans was probably behind the musical score behind it true legend,positive
83,dune part is a visually stunning yet somewhat disjointed cinematic experiencevilleneuves direction is undeniably ambitious and his signature style of breathtaking visuals is on full display in dune the black and white scenes reminiscent of archival footage from fascist germany are particularly striking and add a unique aesthetic to the storytellinghowever the overall pacing and editing of the film leave something to be desired the narrative flow is often disrupted by abrupt cuts and seemingly unconnected scenes it appears that an abundance of material was shot and the process of trimming it down to a manageable length may have been a challenging one despite these efforts the film still clocks in at a lengthy hours and minutesthe plot of dune part bears some resemblance to the tv series game of thrones with its complex political machinations warring factions and power struggles however the films storytelling falls short in comparison to the depth and intricacy of the hbo series the limited runtime of a theatrical release may have constrained the filmmakers ability to fully explore the richness of the source material perhaps a television adaptation would have been a more suitable format to delve into the nuances of the dune universe and its charactersin terms of performances austin butlers portrayal of feydrautha is a standout butler brings a magnetic presence and charisma to the role overshadowing even the lead actor timothe chalamet who plays paul atreides chalamet struggles to match the intensity and allure of butlers feydrautha and his performance is merely a shadow in comparisonoverall dune part is a film that aspires to greatness but falls short in its execution the visual spectacle and moments of brilliance are undeniable but the disjointed narrative and uneven pacing prevent it from fully realizing its potential,positive
84,the perception of this movie really depends on several factors books read lynchs version watched inclination to sf and any combination thereto or none of that no one can deny that visuals in this movie are fantastic including sfx but what else there is some occasional acting strictly routine nothing enthusiastic strange editing at moments being nonsense the short scene wit paul drinking water of life routine music lately modern womans voice screaming or vocalizing as they like to say bad writing uneven pace no science and a lot of fiction if one wants great visuals with dense substance right pacing music editing and direction with occasional connection to the literary template by p dick one should watch blade runner by ridley scott for example dune has nothing to do with it the books are too complex for a literal adaptation anyway second part has more substance than the first one but stretched and lost in too long symbolic shots of everything else almost typical modern hollywood so if youe among first three mentioned categories avoid disappointment the rest might find it even great although they cannot explain why pity,positive
85,denis villeneuve proves once again for being one of the greatest filmmakers of our time with dune part being possibly his greatest movie so fardune part is everything you want for a sequel its bigger boulder and slightly better than its predecessor this movie concludes the first movie in a very satisfying way as you keep rooting for paul in his revenge quest and rise to powerthis movie has more action scenes explosions and violence than the first film but keeps the same tone in the world building mysticism and grounded character momentsvisually and technically this movie is masterpiecethere are some scenes that will stay with you even after the credits roll wanting to go see the film again just to relive the spectacle you just witnessed those whove seen it you know which scenes im talking about cgi is also used sparingly just to amplify the screenplay in large scenesdirection and writing of this movie is top notch and satisfying for the viewer the movie creates tension in the beginning and peaks strongly towards the end unlike oppenheimer there are no pacing issuesstorywise the movie succeeds in the message its trying to deliver thanks to the cast and especially timothe calamets strong performance i was worried that paul atreides journey of becoming the chosen jihad messiah would not be believable at all given the main actors young age to my surprise this was all done very well and timothe calamet managed to shift his characters personality in a drastic way which made him seem like a totally different person at the end the kind of fanatic leader the masses would follow this is partly for the credit of the rest of the cast that genuinely seem to worship and uplift the young man to powerhowever there are some minor faults in this movie but only minor since the movie could have been even better and elevated into perfection with only a few fixes in my opinionfirstly the events of the movie and planet arrakis are supposed to control the fate of the entire universe sadly the film doesnt make us feel this intergalactic conflict since it focuses only on the two houses harkonnen and atreides events take place mainly on arrakis and the world isnt expanded much this couldve been fixed with just extra minutes by showing us a few different planets cultures and other great houses reacting to the conflict or talking about it in some manner sadly we dont have a directors cut to show us what couldve beensecondly the movie feels somewhat one dimensional because of the interplay of the story and the music although fantastic hans zimmers score is quite loud and pushes the audience to feel the epicness darkness and sense of doom to the point of exhaustion throughout the hour runtime there arent enough calm and beautiful moments and gentle musical pieces to balance out these emotions other than a few between chani and paulother movies of this genre eg star wars interstellar manage to evoke many different emotions throughout the film but since this movie is mainly about revenge power and conquest the score suits the plot well but in the end the movie evokes only one kind of emotion with its themes and music to complement it this couldve been fixed with maybe revisiting pauls early family life in flashbacks or something else thats tonally different to the main feel of the movie for these reasons i must say i felt a sleight sense of emptiness after leaving the theatredespite these few critiques the movie succeeds on every front and brings home the main theme of revenge and justice in a very satisfying way for the audience and concludes the setup in the first installment very well dune part is an epic visual masterpiece and will remain as one of the greatest scifi films of this generationrating stars,positive
86,cinematography is visually stunning and awe inspiring the sound design is incredible especially of the weaponry the rifle shots look and sound futuristic yet realistic captures the essence of the book while cutting out superfluous parts of the book and also avoiding some of the controversial stuff like the harah character the entire cast nail their performances i do wish denis left in the ecology bits but i understand runtime had to be kept to a reasonable length ending was changed to be more female empowering than the book i guess chani overall was a bit more independent and less submissive in the book chani accepts some traditional gender roles while in the movie it clear that chani is never subservient to paul i knew they would update the story for todays society so the changes expected,positive
87,what a looker timothe chalamet is with his green eyes androgynous face and smooth curly hair he is so photogenic all the time that if you were to pause this movie at certain moments you could swear the still is from one of those fancy fashion commercials hes recently been in under the direction of martin scorsese and denis villeneuve knows thisso much so in fact that hes decided to hype us up even more in part two again taking his time making sure the light on chalamets shouldbe insured face falls at the perfect angle and each grain of sand is venerated akin to lawrence of arabiathe timeless masterpiece epic that villeneuve also adores so yeah the teasing here has intensified but so did the good things the antielitist themes found in frank herberts novel now go deeper into themes of faith religion and manipulation the scope is grander the cinematography jawdropping especially the black and white homeworld of the harkonnen giedi prime on which austin butlers villainous feydrautha steals the show in terms of performance as he spills black blood on white skin and for the first time in villeneuves career there are genuinely funny moments toooverall dune part two is a better movie than its predecessor and its quite a feat to be so without changing or eliminating the flaws of the first movie instead villeneuve proves that he is fully committed to thoroughly dissecting herberts novel to its full power and it pays off even if there is no catharsis in part two the hype train we are being taken over is dense and brutal without going into the chunky plot just know that by the end we are left with one of the greatest cliffhangers in cinema history in which good and evil alternates between characters and the stage is fully set for whats to comeis a dangerous game directorwriter denis villeneuve is playing by making so many promises or maybe its not i am sure a lot of people already felt fully satisfied with this movie even at this point my friend whom i saw the movie with absolutely swears by it calling it one of the greatest scifi movies in recent history me i hope to be able to say the same about its sequelor sequels because if they will turn up on par with their hype my friend will be absolutely right,positive
88,villeneuve wanted this movie to stand on its two feet will still being a continuation of the last film it delivers on both fronts the quality of the shots acting pacing is still there from the last movie you can put both parts together as one movie and it would work the dream sequences were not as impactful as they were in the last movie and almost non existent when paul is enlightened by prescience if we were to look through his mind like it was in the book the message of the danger of charismatic leaders might have been less impactfulwith only a few flaws and nitpicks dune part is worthy of a watch,positive
89,while it without a doubt is a masterclass in editing cinematography sound design casting i cant seem to ignore the glaring flaws the cast as expected is masterclass and i especially really enjoyed bardem and butler this time around and denis will most likely get a best director nomination next yeareven though there is no doubt about its epicness i found it to have an even bigger pacing issue than the first one somewhere midway through it had me looking at my watch wondering if it is close to ending and found out that we are just grazing into the second actthe third act felt rushed and the conclusion while understandably set up for a continuation in messiah felt really undeserving and abrupt i would have liked to expand the third act maybe more minutes just to have the movie conclude at a satisfying point rather than in the middle of the story exactly as the first one did i might pump this up to a if the next movie concludes the story in a satisfying manneroverall a great film with many flaws that i unfortunately cant look past it is one of the great modern sci fis but dare i say didnt exactly live up to the hype see it at the biggest screen possible,positive
90,when i first watched dune two years ago i couldnt get enough of the story or the surrounding lore i read the first book soon after as to immerse myself in knowing what would happen next and to have a better knowledge of the universe at the time in my mind the first part missed out on some things that i felt were important in establishing the overall story however after watching the second part i understand what denis villeneuves vision cinematically needed to go a slightly different direction the battles in the second part were epic and all of the added stuff of paul training was a fun experience im sad to see the whole story arc of thufir hawat as well as pauls child and his bizarre sister being dropped but i understand that when it comes to adapting a novel to the big screen that some things arent as necessaryneeded to build for future installments i loved this movie it was such a great sequel and is helping further the vision of frank herbert,positive
91,first of all too many changes from the book in my opinion the characters felt a bit off i loved much of the visuals in the film i like the world they created felt in line with the book and i liked the choices for the actors portraying harkonnens especially however the emperor just bothered me i thought it was such a horrible choice just terrible otherwise a decent cast overall that fits with the descriptions of the charactersthere were many scenes added that were not in the book and some characters were entirely removed they were not necessarily bad if you didnt read the book like the killing of the baron it worked but i couldnt help but think about that also the child he had with chani is not mentioned his little sister would have been a great twisted character but that was removed too small things here and there that just lowered my enjoyment of the filmit is also crazy long by the end of it i couldnt wait to leave the theatrein the end i feel like it was great visually but i felt that it changed details that i thought needed not changing so that lowered my enjoyment of this film considerably if i was to go back in time id probably watch it at home on my tv instead of the theatre worth watching but i think that all the praises its getting are a bit exaggerated but definitely better than the garbage disney puts out so maybe thats why people love it so much,positive
92,it seems that many movies have become increasingly longer and longer and we groan and bemoan this fact but dune part ii left me wanting more i would love to see an extended edition of this film it is a film that is visually and sonically stunning go and see it on the biggest screen as possible fans of the book may find elements of this adaptation frustrating as it does take a few major deviations from the book yet the film captures the very essence of the novel and brings to life the wild fanaticism of the fremon people whose long awaited messiah emerges this is among some of the most compelling and invigorating storytelling ever brought to life on the big screen does it surpass dune part one yes what about star wars or empire strikes back i dont think so but let me go and watch it again and again before i make such an assessment i am already considering a second and third viewing of this movie maybe even a fourth go and watch this movie it is mesmerizing,positive
93,ive read reviews saying its one of the best scifi films of all time the only explanation for this is that people havent been following the children of dune miniseries when we have followed this beautiful series we cannot really be amazed by these two films by denis villeneuve obviously technically these films are splendid very impressive visually its well written and the fight between paul and feyd was well thought out its denis villeneuve all the same but even if i have not read the original work of frank herbert it seems to me that it is the real problem with any cinematographic adaptation of this saga the original work lacks conceptual depth and is too predictable to have a truly interesting dune film we would have to take more liberties with the original work which is too old in this work there is misogyny paul who takes a woman without even caring what she thinks a lot of deus ex machina a lack of seriousness the harkonnen are supposed to be a big threat but when we look at their leader and beast rabban etc besides it is unjustifiable that paul is forced to marry the famous girlin addition these two films have a real major flaw the main actor t chalamet doesnt have what it takes to play a character who is a great fighter and a leader of a nation he is too puny he does not have the build of a fighter for example channing tatum at the same age as him had the charisma for this type of characterbrief this saga is yet another demonstration that peoples overall level of discernment is in serious trouble,positive
94,dune was written in and it stood the test of time by making a movie named dune why dont u stick by source material what is this irresistible urge to alter a perfect story with ur mediocre ideasi will come to straight to point u ruined the character of paul he is a prophet figure who never wanted war but he was forced to choose that way because it was the only way yet in the final scenes he ordered his men to go and fight he never did anything like this in the books take them to paradise wtf it was the sister alia who despite being child came to throne room killed baron threatened reverend mother laughed at emperor she achieved many more feats but she wasnt even born in this movie wtf how long is pauls mother going to be pregnant how ridiculous this is paul was exiled and then he formed an army and conquered a planet yet his mother is still pregnant wtf i was most upset by chani the book chani i love her she supported paul the most she loved paul so much she was pauls everything they also had a son by this time paul married princess irulan but never touched her chani understood it was a political marriage it was to save her planet chani in the books is so intelligent calm brave and she respects paulin the movie chani is only making faces on everything paul is doing when every fremen is supporting paul his own wife which is supposed to support him is against him when he ascended to power in the caves infront of all fremen she is the only one defying him wtf is this character assassination the ending actually made me like wtf did i watch my gf asked me if chani is going to be against paul in the next movie and my only reply was that they assassinated her character i need to calm down deep breaths where is the spice guild spice guild emperor and great houses they form the whole power system each holding rd of the power they were shown in the st movie when they didnt deviate from books they had a major role in the throne room negotiations but wow they werent even in the movie itself wtfthere are some good things alsoas i already mentioned dune was very good i recommended that movie to many many people first half of dune was also good cinematography music the grandness but they ruined the second half especially the ending when it ended on the face of very very angry chanithey did same with witcher with game of thrones they ruined mcu too why cant they respect the original writer who thought all this the original story which made it famous in the first place why cant hollywood stick to the source material with minor tweaking rather than completely messing with it in the wrong way the way things are looking dune is going to be further away from the books,positive
95,this was a more than competent follow up to s dune which didnt carry a part included in the title as an early movie release much of its impact will be gone by the time the next awards season arrives but true film fans will recognize it as a top contender for the years best even if weve got more than a half year to go yet as i write this visually the picture is more than impressive however i was expecting more from the scenes of the shaihulud the giant sand worm that the storys hero summoned to demonstrate his acceptance as the muad dib of the fremen people the one who points the way the one paul atreides timothe chalamet rode was all but invisible contrasted with those scenes in which a sand worm engulfed enemies of the fremen earlier in the picture reminiscent of jabba the hutts favorite pet sarlacc from star warsone thing that seemed ambiguous was the relationship between paul and chani zendaya at times her facial and body language showed disapproval with paul even as they expressed their undying love for each other i can only attribute that to the fact that paul was an outsider to the fremens and his stature as the future lisan algaib might have been considered heretical even so her obvious disapproval with paul at various times felt out of place except near the end when paul expressed his willingness to marry princess iluran florence pugh daughter of the emperor christopher walken right after he told chani he would love her forever at that point it felt like paul was acting more on his own behalf in a quest for power than what was appropriate for the fremensa major surprise for this viewer was the casting of austin butler in the role of feydrautha nephew of baron vladimir harkonnen stellan skarsgrd i didnt recognize the elvis actor in his albino guise as the promised future emperor once again in terms of an ambiguous outcome i couldnt perceive how paul reversed his enemys knife to defeat feydrautha in the final contest for the emperors throne and finally how weve gotten this far into the story to find out only now that pauls mother jessica rebecca ferguson was a harkonnen was quite troubling how would pauls deceased father not have known and consequently the viewer that twist sort of defied ones understanding of the relationships among the principal characterslastly where one might have expected a definitive resolution to the dune saga the story leaves threads hanging with the impending birth of the mystical baby girl carried by reverend mother jessica and the fierce resolve of chani in abandoning paul i had not gone beyond the original frank herbert dune novel myself and this films conclusion points me in the direction of following up with dune messiah,positive
96,before i get into detail about this movie i just want to say that its a fantastic movie and its everything i wanted from the sequelthe story is on point its very well paced and it doesnt drag like some parts of the first movie the dialogue is well written and impactfulthe main character arc is awesome the story arc of other supporting characters is also very well done they have great character development the new antagonist is awesomethe production value was very good the score like the last film was amazing the editing was on point i just have nothing but good things to say about this movie,positive
97,there are a few films that define the time i had star wars trilogy as a kid my first son had lotr the second had harry potter and then for while it seemed like we were left with unending marvel tripe embarrassing butchering of star wars franchise and shallow remakes of well everythingand now finally i can say that my third son has a movie for his generation beautiful complex thoughtprovoking and epic the movie that can extend his world into a fantasy realm thats not about wearing latex and shooting everything that moves its movie where nuance is discovered through many conversations with friends and lessons learned through experiencing the real world with the new lensamazing,positive
98,overall much better than dune part most of the actors were well cast and they acted well the visuals were fantastic and it really made the world come alive paul was believable and jessica is perfect really no complaints with the main actors except chani sadly they ruined chanis character in the books she is pauls primary supporter and she grounds him here chani is abrasive and antagonizes him it was extremely annoying watching this extremely important character be butchered by zendaya hopefully she is redeemed in the next iteration but even if she is the film and series is hurt by this baffling direction,positive
99,unlike dune part the wonderful otherworldly music in dune part didnt drown out the softspoken dialogues that said by the sparse music soundtrack my hunch is the producers director and music editors went too far in the other directiondune part continued the same aweinspiring cinematography and breathtaking visual effects however its sometimesmundane script and pedestrian storyline was held together by a superior solid acting and editing the costuming was for the most part magnificent however in a couple of battle scenes the nearly identical battle garb made it very difficult to tell the good guys from the bad guys but the scenes of the good guys riding atop the gigantic desert worms was absolutely thrilling wound i recommend watching dune part absolutely,positive
100,dune part two is about paul atreidess selfdoubt of himself being the messiah of fremen and his desire to take revenge on his fathers murder and extermination of his house contrary to his fathers view on revengethis movie dwelled mostly on paul exploring whether he needed to be the messiah of the fremen or not but that made his revolt plot against the emperor look underwhelming chani loves and helps paul for his dedication to knowing the ways of fremen but she envies him that he is the messiah as most fremen expect to be thats a contradiction to be within one character feydrautha tried to be badass in his introduction scene but it failed instead making him look like a puny who thinks of himself as badass there is no weight in this character the worst villain portrayalnow i am interested and delved into what paul will do to the bene gesserit for the game they played with his houses and turning other houses against him in the name of prophecies as they are the actual villains convincing the emperor to slay the house atredies they are getting ready to accept and adapt themselves to whoever will win the emperor by marrying the emperors daughter to a new emperor they will make sure that they exist after the holy waras the movie is slowpaced while watching for the first time i paid full attention without getting bored but the second time i got bored mostly especially with the scenes i felt as drawbacksthe actors did a great job especially timothe chalamet and zendaya the director built the world amazingly he focused more on how paul atreides evolved in the dilemma of being a messiah or being a part of fremens revolution the cinematography was good as it captured the dune desert in a stunning way and amazing shots on the worm riding scenes dialogues and giving meaning to characters names as the prophecy describes them were a good touch to the movie the music and sound effects were great and not more or less than the scenes requiredoverall my opinion is that its a good movie but with some flaws as i mentioned and it had more story and character depth than dune part one i would definitely recommend this movie if you enjoy the movies in which the story happens in a completely fictional world or universe then youll enjoy this movie and its prequeli know nothing about the book these are my thoughts just on the movie,positive
101,denis villeneuves second half of his adaptation of frank herberts dune fully embraces the spectacle inherent in the material while also digging into the core implications that herbert was exploring around power cults of personality and leadership he flips some things around im pretty sure but otherwise delivers a handsome exciting second half to what he had started and then he highlights chani way too much changing her character so much that she sticks out like a sore thumb to curious purposes that do little more than distract from whats going on around her seriously if the final twenty seconds of this film were chopped off and lost in a fire id actually be a good bit more positive on the filmpaul atreides timothee chalamet and his mother the lady jessica rebecca ferguson have joined the fremen led by stilgar javier barden paul grows close to chani zendaya who helps teach him the ways of the desert as they go into hiding from the dominant harkonnen led by the baron stellan skarsgard his elder nephew rabban dave bautista left as governor of the desert planet arrakis while the baron continues to groom his younger nephew feyd austin butler towards leadership operating as an exposition dump for those who didnt remember the first film is irulan florence pugh nominally taking up her chronicling duties from the book her entries marking the start of every chapter while her father the emperor shaddam iv christopher walken quietly ruminates on the implications of his plan to eradicate the atreides perhaps failingthis is one of those stories that i know so well that i kind of assume that everyone knows and yet dune for all its popularity among scifi nerds isnt the grand cultural touchpoint its sometimes made out to be its influences are strong and wide but the actual story knowledge isntanyway nows the time to talk about some creative choices the first that screams out to me is how much more stylized visually the film is the film opens with a scene of harkonnen troops attacking the fremen in the desert and villeneuve uses a partial eclipse as an excuse to bathe the entire scene in a deep orange its really nice to look at ive been curious about the black and white segments in the trailers since ive seen them and the explanation is that geidi prime has a black sun making it so that outside just looks like that knowing more from the books id say that the whole harkonnen look is something id attribute more to the bene tlielax but its at least interesting to seetheres a heavy emphasis on the bene gesserit and their breeding program in here which i appreciate i think that most heavily gets highlighted in the inclusion of lady margot fenring lea seydoux a bene gesserit sent to geidi prime to seduce feyd secure his bloodline and learn how to manipulate him should certain probabilities arise she is very briefly seen in a modified form in the scifi channel series but otherwise shes never made an appearance in an adaptation although unless villeneuve is planning on using material from the sequel novels written by brian herbert please no lady fenring shouldnt be making any more appearances making this feel like something of a dead end that still manages to provide some nice detail in terms of worldbuildingand that leads me to the editing i like how much detail gets brought in to help fill out the world universe of dune but there are some places where the film feels too fast take for instance the jump from paul and chani sitting on a dune watching a wormrider in the distance chani explaining to paul that hell never become a rider because hes not really fremen cut ahead to about fifteen minutes later in screentime theres been no mention of paul training or anything and now its time for paul to ride his first worm time has obviously passed and this feels like the instance of a cut scene that was deemed unnecessary however considering how much time gets dedicated to fenrings seduction of feyd it makes you wonder if the priorities were in total alignment when cutting the film down to its current lengthso paul stays in the northern parts of arrakis to lead the small revolt of the fedaykin fighters against the harkonnen while jessica pregnant and having become the fremens reverend mother through the changing of the water of life from poison into a harmless drink no orgy in this mostly sexless adaptation a process that awakens her unborn daughter alia into consciousness gonna be honest jessica talking to alia outloud is great its just the right kind of funny in this universe anyway jessica becomes a fanatic in the pursuit of pauls legend as the mahdi the lisan algaib the voice from the outer world while paul resists it if i remember correctly this is something of a complete reversal where paul easily fell into the legend to help him fight while jessica saw it as something of a survival mechanism an unfortunate path she had to take to stay alive i dont mind this change because furgeson as a madwoman is great to watchthings escalate the emperor must come to arrakis there is a showdown and that showdown is great it reminded me of the epic ending to james camerons avatar a movie i have no great love for but which i cannot deny has a freaking awesome final act action sequence atomics worms giant spaceships it all comes together in an action and special effects extravaganza that villeneuve manages with aplomb its great funnow chani chani is given extra prominence and i really dont like how they did it she is one of the fremen who does not believe in the lisan algaib and she sticks to that belief through everything she witnesses as paul is presenting all of the signs as chani herself is becoming part of the prophecy that she rejects through literal actions she not only resists but she fights back against it its so out of place and it goes through to the end of the film sure herbert having chani blithely accept that the love of her life is going to marry an imperial princess for power was always a bit thin but turning the ending of the film into watching her pouting is just wrongthe story of dune is paul going from boy to man to leader to godhead its not chani being mad that paul is going from boy to man to leader to godhead ending on her was a mistakeanyway its a spectacle i think it gets the heart of herberts message right it mixes things up to some degree and to not entirely successful effect as an adaptation of dune i think the scifi miniseries is probably the best but as a filmed experience this is the more exciting and complete of the three attempts,positive
102,dune part two interestingly compellingreligion can be a controversial topic some like me believe in it and others do not with so many people believing different things and so many religions in the world it can be hard to make a movie around this topic it is not impossible however since other shows have done it such as his dark materials lucifer and dune dune part one and two is directed by denis villeneuve starring timothee chalamet and zendaya from spiderman the homecoming trilogypaul atreides chalamet is now with the fremen people trying to fulfill the prophecy paul also wants revenge on baron harkonnen who killed his father meanwhile the harkonnens want to take over the desert arrakis from the fremendune part two is a movie with lots of action people riding cool creatures and has incredible acting what makes this movie so compelling is the religious aspect chalamet is compelling when portraying paul someone who at first did not believe the prophecy but soon learns his purpose in life from part one he grows into a good fighter and someone who people wanted to follow zendaya portrays chani one of the fremen people by the end i felt bad for her since she was alone however she stuck to her beliefs even when everyone else decided to go in a different direction zendaya does an excellent job at playing someone that does not believe in the prophecy but cares about paul i enjoy seeing zendaya expand her horizons going from a love interest in a superhero movie to a love interest and a strong warrior in a drama rebecca ferguson played pauls mother lady jessica who was the first one who wanted her son to fulfill the prophecy she is a part of the bene gesserit a religious sisterhood her main goal is to train her son to become who she thinks he will be austin butler is the nephew of the guy in charge of house harkonnen feydrautha likes to kill people for fun and is a good fighter the relationship between the two houses atreides and harkonnens is complicated which makes the audience want to know what is going to happenunfortunately no one taught me anything about religion when i was younger my first introduction to it was watching the show lucifer which i think is sad this is why i think making movies with religious meaning behind them is a wonderful thing to do i have had a hard year with death and sickness in my family and religion has somehow become a topic i like to discuss therefore this is why i found dune part two better than part one the religious aspect made the movie more interesting and compelling to watch,positive
103,dune is one of my favourite ever books for the last years and i was super excited to see villeneuves adaptation contrary to most people i quite liked the david lynch movie but expected this to be a massive step forward sadly like most of villeneuves movies it is all style no substancethe visuals are beautiful it is one of the most aesthetically appealing movies i have ever seen unfortunately thats about it for the positives the cast is alister from start to finish but too many of them have been cast because they are famous rather than because they fit the character ie christopher walken as the emperor the plot wanders away from the book quite a bit and ignores any real character developmentoverall the movie left me cold it looks great sounds great but i just didnt care i wish i had taken the hours from watching the two movies and read the book again instead,positive
104,where do i bring well this movie is not good everyone heaping praise on it must be drunk or so starved for anything that looks good that theyll just blindly nod and smileits slow and i dont mean regular slow i mean zak snyder super slow if youre going to make a movie three hours long fill it will interesting characters a d good dialogue dont just fill it with scenes that add nothing to the storysecondly and this is my biggest gripe why do timothee and zendaya sounds the like theyre a couple of californian kids there for spring break pauls mum doesnt even bother hiding her british accent javier is the only one putting in any effort to sound like an indigenous populationplot holes so many plot holes in the beginning pauls mum magically transports to kill someone about to kill paul howthe freemen attack the harkonnen and no the ship has guns zendaya has a gun but everyone else sword fights for some reasonpaul rides a worm worm could at any moment dive deep and the rider is dead this is some of the stupidest writing i have ever readchemistry zendaya and timothee dont have anyvisuals amazing the movie looks incredible which is why i imagine everyone is gushing over iti never write review but this movie annoyed me so much i had to vent please stop praising terrible movies because well keep getting terrible movies,negative
105,dune is in my opinion what modern science fiction and fantasy need it is a phenomenally shot film with amazing performance from timothe chalamet and zendaya the story is interesting and kept me engaged the whole hours and minute runtime all that and an absolutely breathtaking soundtrack thanks to hans zimmer my only issue with the film was that in my opinion the pacing was a bit off a friend of mine who has read the books was a little bit dissapointed in the film according to him the books go more into deatail about some caracters backstory and overall weaves a much more interesting story but i am not reviewing the book and hes not reviewing the movie and i think that as a stand alone film it is a masterpiece,positive
106,denis villeneuve continues to provide strong direction writing and atmospheres throughout this movie as villeneuve perfectly captures the characters essence and themes of dune the camerawork the visuals the colors and production designs are all fantastic as it helped create the world and settings within the characters and tone various scenes of action thrills and tension were all wellexecuted and done beautifully with many allstar cast members all performances were great with not a single performance feeling dull or out of placesince i havent read the original book yet i may not be too familiar with the lore of dune but the narrative is pretty interesting as some of the concepts characters and themes explored are pretty good including a great soundtrack uses of dialogue and structures throughout i honestly dont have any complaints about this one because i was enthralled with the entire movieoverall dune part two is a great continuation of the first film and villeneuve has proven to be one of the best filmmakers we have right now,positive
107,yeap thats how it is done second part leaves me literally flabbergasted glorious action strong performances story i mean absolutely everything is just perfectthing is im a big fan of david lynch and so of the original dunebasically because of thati really didnt think that i would like the new one what i can say not only i was wrong but the new version impressed the hell out of mecant wait for the continuationhope tgat it will be as brilliant as the first two partsgood sometimes to get proof that the cinematography is not dead yeteven though sometimes it fells so,positive
108,just got out of an early screening in imax mm and it was amazing the visuals and cgi in this film were excellent and it was cinematographically better than dune part even a lot happens in this movie storywise and the pacing was very good denis villeneuve uses beautiful filmmaking techniques and the end result is just stunning the contrast between one black and white scene and the rest of the movie being colored was a brilliant move and really leaves the audiences mouth hanging and hair standing up in suspense there are many twistssurprises in the story and they are all executed flawlessly i never felt bored in this movie the action scenes and the swordknife fighting scenes were also very well choreographed and it was definitely refreshing to see this movie was much better than dune part in terms of story cinematography cgi and everything else and this movie definitely sets up dune in a perfect way overall the movie was fantastic a mustwatch and i highly recommend watching it in imax,positive
109,the storyline was so powerful and wasnt dragged out like it was a bit with the first one here every scene felt so important and the dialogue is so impactful and inspiringcharacter development can sometimes be a bit tricky with movies who are dealing with a lot of characters yet here they handled it wonderful the main and supporting characters each had something to bring to the tableediting score cinematography acting all perfect also i saw it in imax which made it way more better so i have nothing but good things to say about this masterpiece i recommend this on the biggest screen possible,positive
110,so dissapointed i was i seriously thought of leaving half way through at times it progressed very slow then it started to rush too much some scenes were cringe and badly written for instance draxs big revenge moment paul and his mother suddenly seemed to turn evil without much explanation i found it to be incosistent and incoherenta bit boring mind you i am a huge fan of the genre and i thought timothy and zendaya were great it gets a from me only for the cgi video editing etc the cool worm riding moments best thing about this movie and awesome cast btw dis anyone else notice how pointless the fight scenes were there was no tension paul and the freemen had the upperhand each time hands down,negative
111,this movie is def in my top ten movies of all time with dune part one as well timothees acting was superb the cinematography was beautiful the directing was great and the music was powerful i also love javier as stilgar and zendaya as chani both great performances i havent read the book so im not sure how it differs but i did see the first movie and the limited seriesyou just cant beat this version i dont think anything will top this movie this year and i cant wait for messiahit really is hard to put into words the brilliance of this film all i can say is you need to see it right now,positive
112,i think most the ppl who claim dune to be the masterpiece are not familiar with cinematography at all perhaps they are young generation ppl who missed real masterpieces of the past when acting dialogues and story telling were the most important aspects of the movie not just flashy special effects like we have nowadays in movie and music industry i really liked the first part but it was still far from a masterpiece the second part i rate even lower both are good and entertaining movies but acting and story telling is not there to even consider a good the highest notes go to the scenography and music very well done,positive
113,i gave this mess of a film stars simply on the weight of the special effects and cinematography the worm riding was the best part of the film the interaction between the main characters are shallow and most often miss the main themes of the source materialand why did tge director change one of the main plot points pauls sister alia is born early with all the bene gesserit powers she kills vladimir harkonin not paul this completely changes the story line and not in a good wayi thought the first movie was a snooze fest but kept telling myself just wait until part when all the action happens was i wrongi will never trust denis villeneuve again,positive
114,wowsimply wow what an amazing experience this is epic filmmaking im a firm believer this will be the one to beat at the oscars in no doubt breathtakingly shot masterfully crafted expertly performed the quickest nearly hr film ive ever seen omgthis could change scifi no scratch that filmmaking in general moving forward this has seriously set the standard for hollywood quality denis best get the best achievement in directing for this effort he has more than earned it here such an astounding achievement overall for me it was a perfect film it has everything you want in a film good story intriguing characters touching drama exciting action seriously this film has it all go out treat yourself to the and im gonna say it the best film of,positive
115,really enjoyed this second installment of dune it feels mostly true to the book with a couple notable exceptions the book does not paint chani as being in opposition to paul she is with the program the whole way and even understands why paul must take irulan to wife rather than her also it is alia who kills baron harkonnen with a gom jabbar not paul with a knifeother than these two plot diversions the movie kept my interest and the pacing was fine a bit slow at the beginning but speeding up as the movie went along right up to the final scene at the end i wanted more hopefully dune will explore both children of dune and dune messiah the special effects were first rate again all in all an enjoyable movie,positive
116,i think that watching this film in a regular theatre or on tv must be a very different experience than what i had watching it in imax in fact ive only ever seen dune both parts in imax so i cant really judge the movie in any other format however the crushing sense of scale is so important for the feeling you get from this and the previous entry that i really cant imagine the same effect from watching it on your phone or something so do see it on the largest loudest screen you can findwith that out of the way lets get to the film proper at nearly hours long i could have easily sat on my chair for double that time and still not be bored the second instalment of dune is a miracle in several ways a miracle of special effects set and costume design and of storytelling that manages to make a famously unwieldy story perfectly easy to parse but it is above all a miracle of pacing there isnt a second of boredom or a low point in the movie its an epic in the true sense of the term you spend half the time crushed by scale and the other half lost in the details of the moviemanaging to tell a complex political tale with a surprisingly small amount of dialogue or exposition the film also makes several very smart changes to the book which i really want to see pay off in the third movie there will be one as this ends in a cliffhanger in terms of acting everyone is pretty good but the addition of austin butler as the psychotic feydrautha harkonnen is the real standout here florence pugh is promising but has a limited role which if this is anything like the books will be greatly extended in the third movie a real masterpiece,positive
117,dune is an increbdile film with amazing visuals i was shocked at how good the movie turned outthe first dune movie got me confused because the storyline was a bit complicatedbut i watched the movie a second time and after that i fell in love with itdenis villenueve brought an amazing movie to life with its unbelievable visuals and charactersit draws you under its spell and you can not get enough of iti would want to watch it again and againthe new characters are good choosen and bring a new depth to the movie i am a huge fan of the director and hope to see more of this kind if movies,positive
118,rating watched on feb th fan first premiere event format digital imaxits safe to say that dune part is basically an expansion of part one more characters are added the story is now more complex and x interesting with much going on and the world of dune is biggerhowever with lots of negativities in my opinion the positivities are much stronger to not ruin the experience nor lower the ratingdirector denis villeneuve proves himself again in part two that he is the perfect director to direct the dune project in addition all the crew that helped in delivering this project truly did an accurate and amazing job to deliver this world the way it is supposed to be deliveredthe vfx in this film is absolutely amazing and not noticeable expect for very few scenes that is obvious about the use of green screens but this will not ruin the experience at all also the cinematography that captures arrakis where most of the film is held in absolutely supports the vfx in capturing some great shots that most of them are long wide shots to capture the beautiful desert moreover most of the times the characters are positioned to be in the middle of the long wide shot to capture the size of the character comparing to the world around them mostly to show off their vulnerability or their strong abilities depending in the characterthe film is so much inspired by the middle eastern culture in terms of the language clothings production design movements and all the beliefs that most of the characters followhans zimmers music is perfectly composed and really loved how in most of the fight sequences there is no music to be played in the background making the whole attention pointed towards the fight movements which increases the nervousness and tense vibetimothe chalamet and zendaya are absolutely amazing paul atreides played by timothe chalamet have reached his peak and prime level by the end of this film he is no longer the young paul atreides he is the most powerful man in arrakis and no one can top him nor control him he is written with so much care that will make you recall the version that we saw in part one and how his long journey that we experienced with him wasnt that easy and this might be one of the greatest character studiescharacter development stories in cinema history and timothe chalamet had a huge part in achieving that by the end of part two you will realize that chalamet is indeed the perfect actor to portray paul atreides due to chalamets deep portraying during the different stages that his character goes through in this film and mostly moments of anger and strength on other characters however the real surprise is rebecca ferguson as her character really went through many changes in this film in which it was really shown due to rebeccas acting she was absolutely able to deliver the terrifying and powerful characteristics of her character jessica the second biggest surprise is austin butler as fyedrautha as both his makeup design and acting was able to bring this character to screen the way it is suppose to be in the bookfor the negativitieswith the same mistake that is in dune part one part two and the whole dune saga highly needs to be rated r to allow some gore bloody and disgusting violence scenes to be present in the film and part two has the perfect chance due to the amount of fight sequences specifically with austin butlers character feydrautha that had epic fight sequences that were shot in black white and i think its obvious the reason behind shooting them in black whiteunfortunately the seriousness in this film has been lowered significantly especially with javier bardems character stilgar that cracks most of the jokes what happened to stolgar that walked in on oscar isaacs duke leto atredius in part one with much confident and seriousness refusing to give anything about his peoplealso dave batistas character glossu rabban is so weak in this film and we barely saw him defending himself or even being powerful which is something that does not fit with batistas physical appearance nor the characters characteristics or the brutal house harkonnen that he representsnot a spoiler as it was announced by director denis villeneuve lastly in case you didnt know during the london premiere of dune part two actress anya taylorjoy appeared at the red carpet and it was announced that the actress will be having a small surprise appearance role in the film can i understand why this was announced and why wasnt it kept as a surprise like it was this whole time since when do actors and actresses that have a surprise role in a film appear at the red carpet premiere this makes her appearance at the carpet very much useless and it truly ruined the surprise that was kept hidden perfectly the past few years,positive
119,with david lynchs dune being over the span of hours covering the course of the entire dune book causing very large pacing issues and jodorowskys dune never being made due to production issues planned to be hours long with the first two dune adaptations one not releasing having length issues one being long and the other being too short the adaptation of dune by denis villenueve took a different approach by splitting the book in half with the first coming out part one being phenomenal and a near perfect sicfi epic with a perfect pacing each individual plot event feels impactful and heavy the lack of time constraints on part made the movie able to convey its story with weight allowing for a very immersive and enjoyable experience however because denis villenueve decided to split the book in half when adapting it to the big screen a large portion of the story was left for one singular movie the compression of all the events in the nd film lead to a very fast paced movie dune part massively suffers from this extremely fast pacing as each event that should be absolutely epic and meant to leave you in awe instead make you overwhelmed and thus makes the exciting events much less epic the film is absolutely fantastic as anybody who read the book knows the book is split into main parts i believe it wouldve been perfect if it were to be a dune trilogy instead dune part is henna scifi epicness but i simply cannot give it a due to its extremely fast pacing by squishing all of the awesome events into one movie a lot of the moments that left you in awe from the part are quite lost for me still amazing and if you ever see this movie getting a rerelease in theaters for when dune messiah releases or the miniseries on max i fully recommend checking it out if you love scifi and just want to watch an entertaining movie i really do recommend dune part i also should add to never watch this on a tiny screen do frank herberts and denis villeneuve some justice and give it the big screen it deserves,positive
120,i liked dune part better than this sequel its visuals were better and the story and acting were good to at least half decentit sparked enough interest in me to at least want to see morei was hoping to see the guild navigators and the folding of spacepart here almost had me snoozing off mid moviethe acting was weak and wooden and unconvincing from the principle charactersespecially timothy and the woman playing his mother ive seen the original dune movie from the s many times and frankly it blows the current away as far as creating a surreal world and drawing you in with fascinating characterseven the old by todays standards effects and cinematography were levels above the big budget attempts of the current moviethis one today feels effects laden but devoid of soul that essense that was captured in the original so well i also really like the children of dune series its characters surpassing the interest i found in the current story here to each his ownits visually very good but visuals alone do not make a story hold the interest of the viewer that takes good writing and compelling acting qualities absent in this movie,positive
121,this was an awesome movie clear up to the end and then the last minutes was like a punch in the gut ive read the book and saw the original with kyle mclaughlin and i just love this type of genre i even published a few books myself but the ending just did not satisfy me at all seems like there are a lot of remakes anymore and they usually end up so so to be fair i love the actors i love the way it was directed and overall the movie was well done thank you the cast and crew did an excellent job on this movie and i will watch it again i was just disappointed in the ending this movie deserves stars but in good conscience i cant do that just my humble opinion thats all,positive
122,dune part was okay dune part is better but ultimately far more shallow theres a lot more stuff that happens in part but the core of the dune story is losti liked the film the film looks great the cgi is great its paced well and its an enjoyable ride the actors all do a good job big scenes neat visuals and so on it has an epic feel but its only skindeeptheres barely any depth to the story youre seeing thingsevents obviously happen but its like its a summary of a story rather than the story itself theres zero tension or danger in the story there are no stakes no danger no victory the characters just do things but never seem to actually experience anything there is no hardship no loss no vistorythere are no thrills because there is no danger there are no stakes because paul and the fremen never lose there is no victory because the audience never feels like the good guys might lose there is absolutely nothing thoughtprovoking in the slightest there are no philosophical ideas unlike the source novelone review claims the film is thoughtprovoking anyone who finds this film thoughtprovoking is literally braindead and has never experienced actual thoughts the same review claimed it was thrilling using a scene where dave bautista escapes via a helicopter i can tell you honestly that there were no thrills in that scenepaul joins the fremen and then instantly becomes a military leader even his trial of living in the desert is skipped he never experiences any trials or danger events just happen with no buildup there is no emotional connection to anything happeningunfortunately its ultimately all spectacle with no heart the story is epic the vistas epic the everything is epic except the story,positive
123,lawrence of arabia without the depththe pacing was the problem it was far too slow for the first then rushed at the end it meandered with little sense of what the point was at timeschalamet just became a megalomaniac quite abruptly with very little development and there was no surprise that he was going to become a messiah his big challenge of riding a sand worm the biggest ever seen of course was predictably successfulwhy was jessica chosen to be the fremen mother superior when outsiders were so distrustedtoo little explanation even though there was plenty of time to do sobaron harkonnen became quite ineffectualthe emperor was just a feeble old man where did his power come from his fighters seemed quite average he landed on the arakkis and was defeated easilyi enjoyed part more because the characters were fresh and were more engaging in part they seemed a little empty and caricatured part seemed more of a grindthe exploration of religion fanaticism freedom fighting vs terrorism was interesting and unusual for a scifi movie it does stand head and shoulders above most blockbustersof course the visuals were stunning as was the teethrattling soundalthough i admire the directors more measured approach ie not just churning out a sequel im not sure im excited enough for a part addendum on reflection i am even less impressed by this movie the pacing would have been ok i thought it was ok at the time except it was all ruined by the last minsthe big climactic fight is a dud the soldiers waving their teeny swords at the sand worms is ludicrous why all the sword fights when lasers and machine guns have been used earlier paul just marches into the emperors supertech ship the guards are impotent the suddenly pathetic harkonnen is just stabbed the emperor looks bewildered and tired the big knife fight is predictable and quite pointlessand then paul sends his ragtag taliban desert warriors who have never been offplanet off to fight space armies in part but i guess if theyre all as ineffectual as the emperor and his elite guard and the entire harkonnen clan then im sure theyll do just finei wont be watching,positive
124,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie given the great story and masterful execution there were some changes from the books but they were modest in scope and actually seemed like smart decisions thats kind of amazing all by itselfzendaya rebecca ferguson josh brolin stellan skarsgrd charlotte rampling la seydoux and imho even christopher walken were all wellchosen for their roles i appreciate good castingi happen to have read the books which i thought were soso unlike my friends so i dont understand the reviews whining about the movie being disappointing the story and specific effects are topnotch the experience is highly immersive what else do you needi give this seven stars plus a onestar bonus for the excellent adaption a halfstar bonus for the perfect pacing and quarterstar bonuses for javier bardem and florence pugh whose performances i particularly enjoyed thats nine stars total she didnt get much screen time true but i thought she was great she seemed a tiny bit awkward andor uncomfortable which for me is just part of her realism and stage presence oh what complexities must lie hidden beneath the surface,positive
125,a fan of dune should absolutely read the books the rich tapestry of details and stories present in the novels are often missing or condensed in the film adaptations the depth of worldbuilding and character development in frank herberts work transports readers to an expansive and immersive universe that the movies can only hint athowever my current rating of the dune movie takes into account the overall quality of films released in recent years compared to the many lackluster movies that have flooded the market dune stands out for its ambition visual splendor and attempt to faithfully capture the essence of herberts vision even if it inevitably falls short of the books depth,positive
126,this movie was phenomenal the cinematography was beautifully the cgi was incredibly impressive and the acting was amazing it directly follows up the first movie and keeps the same pacing while also adding more elements of action comedy and heart my only complaint is that some of the transitions felt a bit abrupt but besides that it was the perfect movie this is a must see in imax it just completed the whole experience for me hollywood knows what they are doing with this franchise i can only hope they get their act together and start to make more movies of this same quality absolutely loved it,positive
127,this movie about paul atreides who unites with chani and the fremen while seeking revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family is a masterpiecejust what i expected definitely better on a rewatch i loved it after my firsttime watch but now i love it even more now i am obsessed with it and cannot wait for the next sequel during my firsttime watch there were several elements that slightly detracted my experience like the time jumps small and confusing but important details pacing and the deal with antagonists there are still a few minor issues that i still think could have been done better but now that i am already aware of them i really do not care only the positive elements are visible to me because the original issues i had with it make much more sense now and feel just righti love the world introductions in dune when we see everything for the first time you just forget your own reality while being soaked into its fictional world once you have a good enough understanding and overview of the story and characters the show goes on especially in dune part two the first movie is like a cold and dark introduction but the second movie is more of a powerful and dangerous soul the line by the father duke leto atreides of the protagonist paul atreides a great man doesnt seek to lead he is called to it is the perfect slogan for dune part two and dune part two masterfully translates it into drama action and adventure during my previous watch i looked at the movie as more like the good versus the evil but now my only focus is on paul everything is about him himself he is the one who moves the people he is the one who makes a change for the world my focus was too much on the antagonists during my firsttime watch because i was disappointed with how easily they were defeated after a huge buildup but now i see that part as a strengthening element to the depiction of paul as lisan al gaib the weaknesses of the antagonists make paul so much more powerful and i love itin terms of the technical aspects they are probably the best ones i have ever experienced they are not perfect but you cannot get much better quality in dune part two has everything cinematography sound score cgi practical effects locations costumes makeup props it is mindblowing it is probably the best movie theater experience i have ever had especially because of its technical aspects which does not only make it to a fantastic movie but an actual unforgettable experience and i am grateful for that long live the cinemathis movie surpasses its predecessor the intricate world allows the story to truly flourish paul emerges as the central focus a leader not by choice but by destiny the movie masterfully translates this theme into a thrilling spectacle complete with unparalleled technical achievements it is not only a good versus evil story but a character study of the power and purpose of paul the experience is unforgettable a testament to the magic of cinema,positive
128,this is the lord of the rings movie that people my age missed out on this was a passion project for denis villenueve and it showsif youre looking for a casual movie experience that is easy to digest this is not the movie for you this movie just like the first one doesnt spoon feed you anything it requires attention and application to be fully appreciated luckily its a really easy movie to pay attention to because of how intense and epic it issome of the changes that were made from the book were a little disappointing to me but they were clearly necessary and i could tell that they were made with love and a true and deep understanding of the source material making a bookaccurate alia had the potential to ruin the tone of the entire movie also even though i think baby letos death would have packed a powerful punch and been helpful to inform pauls choices it was rendered impossible with the decision to condense the timeline after watching it i honestly dont think that it could have been done much better than it was,positive
129,an absolutely gorgeous austere piece of film denis villeneuve is serving up some of the most majestic of scientific fiction images weve seen on the st century cinema screen its impossible to say this a bad film or adaptationvilleneuve treats each shot as if it were a painting every design choice seems handed down through millennia of alternative human history from arcane hieroglyphics to a slew of creative masks and veils meant to conceal the faces of those manipulating the levers of power nearly all of them womenherberts dense novel can be a daunting slog for the average reader who cant tell a sandworm from a sardaukar which is one of the reasons villeneuves approach felt like such a breakthrough it pared the mythology down to something manageable serving up visceral action setpieces at regular intervals the movie airdropped audiences in a world where foreign customs politics and technology had long been established never letting the complexity of those elements slow down the storytellingthats not to say villeneuves dune movies are fastpaced channeling the austerity of andrei tarkovsky at times the director takes nearly five hours to cover what david lynch did in just slightly more than two though iconic in some respects the now badly dated version barely scratched the surface of herberts concerns if part two feels slow in places its because villeneuve takes time to develop the connection between characters as in a handful of scenes dedicated to fremen warrior chani zendaya and paul aka muaddib or usul whose undeniable attraction doesnt align with jessicas plans for her sonin many ways overcomes some of the weakness of the first pacing overall felt better obviously less setup the score is used more sparingly in a way that allows many more moments breathe but still suffers from the necessity of cramming so much story into such a small space some beats that need to feel pivotal felt rushed to me and theres not much room for character performance to do the heavy lifting you hardly notice though because youre inside a such stunningly realized alien landscape for the length with so much to look at and take in i enjoyed every moment and cant wait to revisit it soonaudience will find in villeneuves multipart saga a satisfaction few films can offer its an enormous gamble given the expense of creating at this scale and a vote of confidence in cinema which still hasnt recovered to the prepandemic level at play when the franchise was conceived the fate of far more than arrakis is riding on dune,positive
130,theres no question that this film has stunning special effects excellent production values and some decent performances javier bardems crusty but devout stilgar springs to mind but the movie is so long nearly hours whereas i admired the first film for its ability to describe the world of dune with good economy this film seemed overstuffed with events that were hard to understand if you werent overly familiar with the books in addition to realize that all the events jessica influencing the fremen paul learning the fremen ways sabatoging the harkonnens spiceworks paul becomes a messianic figure etc etc etc all took place in less than nine months how do we know jessica is pregnant at the beginning and the end of the film but if you want a film full of spectacle this one definitely has that and credit due some of the scenes are breathtaking,positive
131,dune part is a cinematic masterpiece denis villeneuves direction greig frasers cinematography hans zimmers music and marvelous acts by each and every member of the starcast makes this one of the best movies ever made put denis greig hans tim and austin already as nominees for the oscar you can feel that everyone from the team has given their best this literally was the best cinematic experience i had after interstellar i dont think that any film releasing this year will be able to even match this one i was lucky enough to catch a fan premiere in imax today also the imax experience is worth it,positive
132,in the swirling sands of cinematic experimentation emerges babel babble a visual odyssey through desert landscapes and digital dunes while the cinematography and cgi are undeniably captivating the storys coherence is as elusive as an oasis in the saharaset against a backdrop of shifting sands and sunbleached horizons babel babble immerses viewers in a world where communication is as tangled as the desert undergrowth dialogue flits between languages like mirages on the horizon leaving audiences to decipher a linguistic labyrinth with no map in sightas the plot meanders through the dunes viewers are left to wander alongside the protagonist whose motivations are as inscrutable as the shifting sands beneath their feet attempts to unravel the narrative threads are met with frustration and confusion as the story twists and turns like a sandstorm in the desertyet amidst the narrative quagmire babel babble shines as a visual spectacle each scene is a testament to the beauty of the desert landscape from the golden hues of sunrise to the eerie glow of moonlit sand dunes the cgi seamlessly blends reality and fantasy creating vistas that are both breathtaking and surrealin the end babel babble is a film of contradictions while its visuals transport viewers to stunning desert vistas its story leaves much to be desired its a cinematic journey best enjoyed with a healthy dose of skepticism and a willingness to embrace the absurdity of it all so strap in hold on tight and prepare to be whisked away on a whirlwind tour of linguistic chaos and visual splendor just dont expect to find much coherence along the way,positive
133,it is a veryvery spectacular movie and contains many details from the book still many important details were changed by the directordont see why he made chani so faithless and skeptic why alia hasnt born untill the emperor has been defeated where is thufir mentatliets gender is a problem only if you know the fremens society the leader is always a man and liet was the secret leader of the fremens before paulalso when paul drank from the water of life it wasnt chani who saved him in the book paul neutralizes the poison on his own but needed a reverend mother to find the place where even the reverend mothers could not go as a movie it is spectacular and goodas a dune movie it is not that good,positive
134,dune part is a direct sequel to dune part one the book adapted movie that is very popular now and i gotta say its definitly better than the first because of how simple the story is now and how good the scenes arebut i have some problem with it the first hours are not boring theyre just coudlve been way shorter because of all that filler the first hours are not really great but after the hour mark things shake up and stuff happen and then the movie actually gets goodthe movie is overall good the first hours couldve beenbetter or shorterbut overall dune part is a good movie with good scenes,positive
135,the only reason i liked dune part a little better is just because of the storyline part was largely about the aftermath of part and the buildup to an epic holy war so there was nothing that was done any worse i just liked the character development in part and how they set everything upits beautifully shot and the cinematography is incredible also how it implements sound and silence to sculpt the atmosphere is awesome too the special effects i thought were insane too just with the scope of the machines sandworms explosions and the angles they usedthis is a mustsee if youre a scifi fan obviously watch part first,positive
136,this isnt dune events characters are missing or changed for the worse the plot is dumbed down really hard dialogues are on the level of childrennotchani and notpaul dont have any chemistry together and they behave out of character just like most of the castmajor plot points were left out or changed which makes this a bad movie having nice visuals is not enough you got to have a good script tooit is disrespectful the call this visual diarrhea a dune movie even the version was better not to mention the s mini series you might as well watch an ai generated garbage,positive
137,all the complaints about short fight scenes and characters not getting proper shine or plots not explained are foolishness the reason this movie is so significant is because it wasnt scared to tell a story in an untraditional way i find it funny that everyone says its much better than the first i hated the first movie it was too slow so why the heck did you watch the second movie seems like most people feel this movie directly threatened star wars so they chose to pick sides no matter what brilliance they watched part of what makes dune so unique is the fact that they dont explain every little thing to you like you were a child but most people like their hands held we need more movies like this and less movies from disneymarvelstarwars with predictable outcomes and setups we have seen for decades something fresh real and not shot in a studio,positive
138,dune is very close to the category of masterpiece specialists in the field such as steven spielberg or christopher nolan have already said it and hey will not put their credibility at stakei have read that there are various fandoms of much simpler universes with less talented creators who are condemning the film simply out of resentment or simply people without artistic sensitivityyou can deny it if you watched in the cinema when you got up from your seat you felt like youve just come from an exciting ride on a sandworm all my senses were excited dune is a delight in every department and timothes transformation in this film is something we havent seen from him yet the strength the range of variety and scope really surprised me austin butler steals the show and establishes himself as a solid actor in the industry rebecca ferguson shows that she is at her peak and dennisvilleneuve is established as one of the directors of this century in a single film he manages to handle several rhythms to an almost perfect level the last hour of the film is a scary adrenaline rush the opening sequence is a feast for the eyes and the scene of paul riding the sandworm is magicaldune has revived epic scifi cinema,positive

140,being a long time fan of dune and the books by frank herbert i left dune part two with a sense of confusion at what i had just watcheddenis villeneuve did a phenomenal job with dune part one hands down no question he stayed as true as possible to the original story with very few albeit minor changes from the novel the reasons behind this were understandable deliver frank herberts dune in a manner that modern audiences could digest and walk away from understanding and appreciating what they had just experienceddune part two arrives critics and influencers alike are toting the film as a masterclass of filmmaking and best science fiction movie of all time to datei am fair and give credit where credit is due the characters and their execution of their roles were flawless the cinematography was aweinspiring the action was jawdropping and the musical scoring was outstanding setting every mood and tone perfectlyso why six stars the story hands down the storythere are creative liberties taken by villeneuve that i believe hurts the original material many of these liberties are easily identified in the film by holy crap moments and the gasp moments in the film granted while once again masterfully executed they accomplished exactly what it felt like they were meant to do get shock value whether these changes were studio decisions or villeneuves remains to be seenhad villeneuve followed his original formula from dune part one into dune part two following the narrative from frank herberts original works i still think this film would have impressed beyond measure unfortunately in its release state i believe dune part two fails the audience by robbing them of the true experience that is dune the storythis is how i felt leaving the theater let down is it a visually stunning and well executed movie yes is it true to the source material noi leave viewers enthusiasts and fans of the original novels a fair observation and warning if you want to see an amazing movie you will be pleased if you are going for the story be prepared,positive
141,no doubt this movie is in its own class but the rush with storytelling made it difficult to enjoy all the details the absolute best parts of this film are the several quiet moments containing huge emotions and stopping the time before some worldchanging eventsbut as was said the movie contained a complex story which in some other cases wouldve been divided into two separate films some development happened so fast that the audience were still on the previous planet while the movie already jumped to the next one i felt like i couldnt enjoy those villeneuvishly spectacular scenes as much as they deserved to be enjoyed a second round with this movie is definitely coming for me,positive
142,i didnt read the book i dont care about the book this is a movie so forget about comparing the book to the movie and vice versa pleasei didnt like part one it bored the heck out of me it honestly did i do like part two much better though its vibe is completely different much more bleak and exciting but it also has got its flaws and beware you wont leave the cinema feeling all cheery and revived because this sequel is quite a heavy motherthe bad there is a limit to how long i can stand these contineous hans zimmer droning booming sounds they just do not stop there needs to be some balance in the use of these bombastic sounds a pause a silence now and then only enhances the effect less is moremore bad this movies storyline is all over the place it feels rushed at moments confusing at other moments some characters randomly appear and disappear everybody is rightfully complaining about this sequel being low on storylinethe good part two has got a mean vicious bleak spirit with some really creapy bad guys they really succeeded in making me being appalled by some of these mean characters greatmore good the action is quite dark and intrusive and mesmirising to watch almost hypnotizing action visualsthe really good stuff the actors are simply sublime they just dont come any better although i personally do not like that they choose timothee chalamet for this character i think he is just not suited for this role but that is just my personal opinionvisually it is terrific as always with director denis villeneuve storywise it is kinda disappointing mixed bag certainly not worthy of stars thats simply ridiculous but still worth a really enjoyable heavy mother of a watch nonethelessthank you for reading my th review on imdb,negative
143,first chapter was good long prologue for something more i was expect that part two will surprise me nontrivial story great acting beautiful cinematography and taking all of my attention but miracle not happend first min was good but next two hours i was watching absolutely bored and nonsense movie this is was a real disappointment journey in nothing scene just replace each other there is have no sense just a set of scenes here is some bald guy fight with some kind of people then he going somewhere and kill another guys and so it was for the next two hours just someone going somewhere and do something what for why who are all these people and why they fight i just waste time and the most annoying thing is i even didnt know about third chapter and now i have to wait about years for next chapter i thought that part two will be final film but its not overall i just waste hours while watching this nonsense movie only one thing i was really surprised its performance by javier bardem this is was amazing i like it for first half of this movie rest is trash,positive

145,the cinematography is really good and theres moments of the movie where you feel like youre in it the action scenes are way better in this one as well as the storyline however there are still some moments that dont keep you tuned inthis film does provide more backstory about characters austin butler did a great job and deserved more screen timetimothees delivery as a menacing character could be better but still decentthe sound track is pretty nice and keeps you awake through a lengthy film as dunesome aspects are predictable but it doesnt take away from the filmoverall it is a great movie with great acting,positive
146,i watched dune expecting a continuation of the interesting first part but i left the theater in awe and noticed others leaving equally mesmerized and amazed the film is a masterpiece visually stunning with a compelling story featuring welldeveloped characters and excellent performanceswhile the first film follows the heros journey as we all know it it left a taste of more of the same dune on the other hand while still using this storytelling method twists it in a way that washes away the slight taste of clich from the first film and the director executes this spectacularly its a mustwatch for any scifi fan and undoubtedly one of the best in the genre of all timetoday i was impressed in the best possible way what a happy day,positive
147,dune part two is a very good movie it is a masterpiece in terms of visuals stage designs use of sound acting and the subtext it adapts from the book it is perhaps the best movie that hollywood has offered us in recent years made by the most qualified people but there is some flaws even though the voices of people trying to say it are silenced due to the hype that is raging around still i can also say that it is the most deserved hype i have ever seenthe film has two major issue that are related to each other the first is that the ending of the film is rushed as if the budget or screen time has run out the film moves like it jumps from scene to scene without allowing us to enjoy the final climax moment thus the scary sardaukar we saw in the first movie become meaningless its a bit like the last season of game of thrones here there is a pacing problem honestly i suspect this feeling was because i was so enthused by the quality of the film at the end so i went crazy for seeing more and morethe second problem is alia i understand the difficulty of staging alia thats why it was decided to deviate from the book and keep her in the mothers womb throughout the movie this is a reference that spoils the pacing aspect of the movie which is smooth except for the last act while what we see from pauls and jessicas experiences is meaningful if it is spread over timeline this reference point forces it all to have happened in five or six monthsits a problem that shouldnt even be mentioned but the fact that the fremens battle uniforms did not resemble pauls visions in the first movie made me a little bitterdune is a masterpiece in many senses especially cinematographically in fact what the source story says about people its subtexts and world fiction are amazing i havent been this completely immersed in a movie in a long time i loved how they changed chanis story arc and gave her a personality and i loved how they showed jessicas role more clearly than in the book i loved how they made the character of feyd more meaningful as his place in the grand scheme of thingsso it is not free from some flaws still it is such a good movie that while you normally get bored watching a movie over and over again i love this movie even more by watching it over and over again,positive
148,as an avid enthusiast of photography and videography the cinematic masterpiece that is dune part resonated deeply with me captivating my heart with its breathtaking camera work each frame seemed to be meticulously crafted transforming the screen into a canvas adorned with visually stunning arti got really excited when i received an invite to see dune part early not only was the camera work impressive but the actors and the story were fantastic too making it a memorable experience while i wont say its the best for everyone i think its pretty awesome everything from how they filmed it to the sfx the cast and the story felt almost perfect,positive

151,saw the dune film todayreally enjoyed it and it had some good visualswell worth seeing and i look forward to the inevitable pt but disappointed the new films didnt utilise the bene gesserit weirding way power so no weaponised modules the voice is still used though of courseim all for diversity and given the books mirror on the worlds religions and politics this was fitting to have all cultures involved but was there a need to gender swop as well as race swop a character its a great sci fi film but its not quite the masterpiece its being heralded as imoim sure it will predictably win countless awards fx couple of actors performancesthe script shouldnt though imothe ending felt totally rushed and zero resistance felt no tension far too easy and brief a victory imo could have done with at least another half hour to really feel them gaining ground and getting ever closer to the emperor but nothey were there at the doors in a heartbeat which i was surprised by missed opportunity to build tension suspense and bring great performances from the cast especially walken is wasted here more on that laterfeyd actor wasnt great and looked like a cross between matt lucas little britain and the engineers from prometheus and his birthday scene in the arena seemed pointless and badly executedbatistas lack of acting abilities showed in this to the point he just shouted all his dialogue and hoped for the bestchristopher walken seemed wasted and was never really allowed to embrace the role with the little screen time he had didnt come across as emperor at all no grandeur at all this is the emperor of the universe anyone elsenspot the almost monty python life of brian moment only the true messiah would deny he is the messiah or words there abouts nearly had us shouting out hes not the messiah hes a really naughty boy ha ha again well worth the watch though the religious nods to real life from the book the jihad the politics are there although most is skirted over as it wouldnt make quite an exciting film its more style over substance visually nice yet not hugely engaging intellectuallythe designs for the spaceships seemed a little bland also no real style or identity for each house at least lynch film had some well thought out difference in the look of each houses palace and ships etcbland especially after seeing what h r giger had designed for the harkonen style for a film that sadly never got made many years ago oh how incredible that would have been if only it had happened nownif only we could see lynchs first hr cut ha ha love to see what treasure were inside that versionbring on pt ill still watch it will be popular but they tooling themselves with all thebgushing about masterpiece,positive
152,the films are just okpublic sentiment is against me but here goes whypluses great fx plot follows the trilogy all the big cinematic boxes are ticked fair pacing more on that later some characters are well playednegatives waaaay overacted and i felt like i was watching a s b movie antagonists far too obvious and shallow paul was borderline good at best the battles were poorly choreographed a lot of slashing and posturing reminiscent of and thats not a compliment the whole dreaming and mind talking thing wasnt impactful enough christopher walken is one of my favorite actors but this time he was flat maybe he was poorly directed pacing was too slow with lots of walking and walking and climbing and sand dancing cutting all that out wouldve saved a least a half hour of screen time and it felt like filler to meyeah it did huge box office but to me thats more of an indicator of the general dumbing down of society at large and less a lot less than it being a great film,positive
153,admittedly i was a big fan of the david lynch version and prior to the release of part i was not expecting much i am first to admit when i am wrong and in the case i certainly was does it do the novel justice probably not but it is such an indepth and complicated setting that i am not sure it would be possible back to this both parts taken as one movie really do make a good attempt at telling the story the sound and feel for the environments most of the acting and the special effects are high end i was anticipating a modern reimagining of the characters and plot and although there is a minor element it actually adds to the movie,positive
154,i wasnt expecting to have a religious experience but i guess thats how those sorts of things happen the book is near and dear to me and regardless of the changes made from the book doesnt quite do it justice sure i could knitpick but any issues i might have are more than made up for sometimes you can just feel the reverance and dedication an artist has for the craft and faithfully adapting a classic story what a time to be alive faith in cinema restored completely zendayas chani though she doesnt impact the narrative much frames the thematic structure better than in the book and has a forceful presence and voice that cant be silenced chalamet effortlessly maneuvers between the quiet reserved child of privilege and the crazed messiah willing and able to destory anything in his path javier bardem brings the deep reverance teacher philosopher and comic relief elements seemlessly i dont know where to stop with the cast so ill just leave it there the whole cast is walltowall bullet proof absolute feast for the senses definitely see it in imax if you can i could go on for days two thumbs up with a tear in the bluewithinblue eye thanks denis this made part one look like finger painting,positive
155,no spoilersbut let me be clear my husband is the huge fan of dune and the series of books ive seen the lynches og and i like lynch but it didnt match up to the remake imoso now ill admit im not a fan of this genre and while i did like the first my husband loved it so i pre booked tickets to this one for a first viewing i wasnt anywhere near as excited as himbut my god i didnt want to look away its long at just under hours but it didnt feel it not a single scene was needless or filler the sound was unbelievable the room shook as did the screen visibly at points brilliant loved every minute,positive
156,dune part as a film by itself was incredible the vfx were amazing the plot was really good the acting was stellar the cinematography everything was really well donehowever after about and hour and a half into the film some major changes from the book started to become clear and egregious as someone who read the book i was quite disappointed by some of these changeshowever for anyone who has not read the book this film should be an amazing experience and storydespite my grievances this movies was still incredible i would recommend this film to those who read the book as well just watch it expecting some relatively sizable changes really good movie especially in theater it was not however as good as the first film,positive
157,denis villenueve you have earned my respect you are a geniuswords simply cannot describe just how good dune part two is everything from the score the visuals the acting is a billion times better than part one you have a film that is able to deliverer on action while also being a religious and political drama my excitement of learning more about the world of dune has simply elevated due to this film denis villenueve has created an amazing sci fi entry worthy of joining the hall of fame of sequels simply one of the best films of the past years if the next entry is able to be just as good if not better than this we are looking at the next big saga in cinemathis is what movies were made for,positive
158,but now i have to loved every minutes of it and no its not too long couple of scenes made me tear up just because they were so cool and epic yes its visual masterpiece but it is also so much more it has heart and characters that youll love i laughed more than i thought i would javier bardem was the biggest reason why i was thinking that it has to slow down at some point it just kept going and building up towards to end packed with action and scenes that you find urself holding ur breath i have one negative thing to say about dune part and its that i cant wait years for that next one to come out,positive
159,im not here to upset anyone and i have been reading the reviews since coming out of the movie because i feel confused like i missed somethingmusic acting some action scenes location cgi all absolutely outstanding and im glad i saw it on the big screen but the story just isnt gripping at all and its such a shame because the acting and the casting was spot oni would recommend that every person watches this film once because it is an experience and maybe i will have a more positive opinion once part is out and the full story is there but overall a lot of hype with a minimal payoff at the endlike i said this is my opinion and i hope i can see this film people are raving about if i rewatch it,positive
160,this was an incredible achievement in film i was completely blown away by the cinematography acting writing music and more if it gets topped this year than it will be a legendary film in the history of movies i only had a couple problems but its not with the movie its just that they took out the characters of alia and leto in the book alia kills the baron and leto is brutally murdered by the sardukar other than that which was just a adaption problem i thought it was completely perfect watch my youtube reviews and subscribe to filmrattymy full reviewbeyond brilliance dune part twos cinematic triumph a review of dune part twomy spoiler free reviewno spoilers just wonder dune part two unraveled,positive
161,i didnt like the first movie much besides the production it had i liked the concept and mood of the storyi was expecting this one to be better it wasnt the characters are simple and naive the story isnt deepthey try to talk about religion but not be straightforward with it while they clearly and directly use their phrases and some of their ideology and change few staff to not make the religion or people look badthey dont talk directly about the economy moral implications race gender physic of the world biology and science of tech they use which is missing opportunitythere wasnt much of new design choices location that feel different of the first act was boring but the rd one wasnt bad maybe even enjoyable which wasnt the case for the other act,positive
162,dune had some great cinematography along with great acting however this movie is far from epic the action was sparse but enjoyable after lengthy periods of dialogue the approval rating had me hyped to see this movie it was far from fulfilling for me and my spouse agreeswe would not have paid for this movie had we known it was so disappointingi was hoping for more aspects of the book such as training the fremen in the weirding way where was the secret weapon that feydrautha used in the book when feyd stabbed paul during the fight the first wound was a knife to pauls left side they continued to fight paul killed feyd and the knife wound was in pauls right shoulderi certainly will not be going to the theater to see the next episode we felt that the movie was overrated and would not recommend for people who read the dune books,positive
163,yes dune are probably the best scifi movies ever i cant really come up with anything else that would beat these anywaypart two was a nice continuation to part one however i felt the last part of the movie could have been better or maybe it just went too fast without spoiling its hard to explain also missed some more insight about the mother and a lot of other things as well imagine if this could have been a episode serie with same qualityanyhow visually and the main cast were just excellent i did expect more out of the emperor christofer walkenjust love the tonality of the entire movie and the sound and music made it masterfulplease more of these adult epic scifi movies and series,positive
164,i read the first dune books about years ago i was a pretty big dune dork back in the day but then my interest waned and life got in the way so id say my pov is somewhere between a mega dune fan and the general audience who doesnt know anything about the books zoom forward to and though i was excited for part i wasnt blown away by it though i must admit ive enjoyed part more and more each time ive watched it i went into part more curious than excited but my gosh was i surprised by how much i enjoyed it i was running a little late to my showtime and didnt get a chance to use the restroom before i kept waiting for a slow or boring scene to sneak outand that scene never came every moment felt important and each scene held my attention so completely that i decided the discomfort of needing to void wasnt worth missing a beat so i guess its rather silly to tell you all to use the restroom before but learn from my mistakes dune part is mesmerizing beautiful and heartbreaking all at once its been a really long time since ive had such a visceral reaction to a movie i kept thinking to myself the movies are back and even though its long by the end i was actually sad because i wanted morealthough at least i could finally pee,positive
165,this movie is quite possibly the best scifi film ever made the cinematography the score the chapters and how the story unfolds is so satisfying this is not a to adaptation from the source material obviously but the choices that denisthe director and griegthe cinematographer made were so intelligent the world building is spectacular the fights are action packed the emotional weight in certain scenes is palpable the actors all played their rolls flawlessly with stand out performances by timothy chalemet austin butler javier bardem and zendaya i cant think of anything more they could have done to make this film more enjoyable except perhaps add another hour no question,positive
166,dune part two is one of the greatest creations or triumphs in the history of cinema the worldbuilding and the world itself along with our characters makes you wanna snort a pile full of spice straight from the sand dunes of arrakis and fight alongside paul atreides the entire time thats how immersive the story visuals and music are it is unmatcheda generationdefining film indeed and when we discuss sequels this could very well stand in contrast with the empire strikes back the dark knight and the two towersor even surpass them in some cases we owe denis a great debt for this masterpiece you can keep your expectations as high as the sky but denis will blow your mind either way and show you that even the sky isnt the limit no one was and is prepared for thislong live cinema,positive
167,please keep this going through all six books this is the absolutely best rendering of a very complex story the first dune was ok the bbc mini series was good this kicks it out of the ball yard the characters and acting nail it please keep going because this book series deserves this kind of engagement and understanding the debunking of the messiah myth the conflict is perfectly recognized in this rendition i cant wait for the next part of this and seeing how you render the god emperor i have been a big fan of the books since they came out and have actually used one in one of my classes please keep going perfect,positive
168,i dont know what can you say about this movie that wasnt already said unbelievable cinematography cgi casting fabulous music and villains villneuve did the impossible adapt probably the hardest book ever in the s f universe part one was great but part two is flawless do yourself a favor and watch it in imax seriously you wont regret itwho didnt read the books i envy you to be able to read it for the st time may talk about minor issues with the script but the director was so faithful to the books and you dont see that in hollywood nowadays of course you cant cover and entire book in just and a half hour of a movie but he did it villneuve cements his place in the pantheon of top tier directors with this moviei cant wait for part i refuse to believe there wont be one over the years he said his dream is to make a trilogy and close the circlein the end all i can say is go watch the movie do it in imax and enjoy a mindblowing journey in one of the best movies ever done yes its that good,positive
169,disclaimer i am in my s and have watched the original movie so i am a bit biased i found the first movie gripping and visually astonishing i thought it was an absolute masterpiece i eagerly waited for the second installment of the dune saga having watched the second movie i cannot escape the feeling of disappointment the movie again is a technical master visual effect the sound the imagery what you perceive is fantastic is no doubt technical masterpiece but i feel compared to the first movie that the timeframe has changed and that the storyline altered some elements like the weirdingway of battle were totally missing also the romance between chani and paul was very abruptly ended it actually didnt make any sensebearing in mind that there will be a third movie or rather that there might be a third movie will still watch that and make up my mind when i have seen all three sincerely hope that the third part will close the story circle as it should had they not seen the original one had i not need familiar with the story i would definitely rate this higher because honestly it is a feast for the eyes,positive
170,dune part clocking in at over two hours delivers a captivating cinematic experience the stellar performances meticulous plot execution and aweinspiring cinematography collectively contribute to an outstanding film each actor excels in their role and the costume designs are commendablewhile the movie shines in various aspects it occasionally leans heavily on visual effects reaching a point of excessiveness despite this the overarching narrative brilliantly delves into the theme of religious fanaticism the spiritual motifs in dune draw striking parallels to messianic concepts echoing the biblical narrative of jesus and his mission to liberate humanity from tyranny over years ago in our world overall dune part successfully navigates the delicate balance between visual spectacle and profound storytelling making it a noteworthy cinematic experience,positive
171,there is a wall not a shield wall that protects arrakeen from the deep desert but rather a cultural wall a wall where those who came before are used to a higher quality a finesse in filmmaking which is lost on those who came later who like loud big and absolutely onthenose filmwhile i place on a pedestal the immortal masterpiece by lynch dune was just mediocre not as bad as dune uh but still not really goodi mean i cant forget that i have seen dune so maybe i could like this a bit more if the first film never existed i could forget the magnificent sets the fantastic costumes the amazing soundtrack the superb direction and pacing the acting of jose ferrer of kenneth mcmillian of max von sydow we could forget that lynch figured out that space kungfu wouldnt work and fixed the fighting and the ending but then i would be left only with what little dune has to offer a bunch of bland cgi stolen from the internet horrible costumes and a story which would maybe have better impact if it had anything like a decent direction while villeneuve did the fairly good sicario to me he will always be the guy who made a mockery of blade runnerand here is the wall you either do or do not like you are on one side or the other you cant like the new blade runner and also like the old one you cant like dune and dune at the same time because if you grew up with the cinema sensibility that created such masterpieces as the original dune and blade runner you will simply be bored at the complete lack of artistic quality that their remakes have and if you do like the new ones you dont even know what to look at when youre shown the old onesdune was bad not horrible bad but disappointing sad bad sad that we insult the intelligence of our audience so much and sad that they cant even tellmy vote i dont know if you are a teenager if you are an adult,positive
172,the production value of the sets and scene is spectacular now that is out of the way the movie is very average and nothing really happens the editing is very choppy and the movie keeps jumping here and there everything happens conveniently for the main character the fight sequence which i was waiting for were short and underwhelmingprops to the director for making it almost hours long but still unable to stitch a decent storyline poor zendaya was so underutilized that it made no sense why paul was having dreams of her in the first part his premonitions were so useless his dreams in the first part didnt warn him about the massacres about to happen to his family but kept showing him zendaya really useless superpower to have there are multiple oscar winning actors who have been criminally underutilized josh brolin javier b chris wagain the production value is great and makes it watchable but was too slow nothing really happened and when it happened was underwhelming,positive
173,this is one of the best if not the best sci fi movies ive ever seen sure it felt a bit rushed but it ticked every box for me as far as sci fi movies go the scale of the film fantastic worldbuilding and all of the cast were just amazing i absolutely love the raw and gritty portrail of the world it felt real like that this could actually be a possible future for humanity as i mentioned before it felt a bit rushed sometimes but that is to be expected when you make a movie adaptation of a book so that did not bother me that much i do however believe that this film needs to be rated r in order for it to reach its fullest potential showing a bit more realism in the battles etc would have made this a for me however the action was still great and the final fight scene was so fin good,positive
174,this is one of the best cinema experiences i have ever had when i watch modern films i am often turned off by the poorly thoughtout story contemporary political issues and extremely inappropriate humor and swearing this is a film adaptation of a story that is unfamiliar to me well they got a fan its not so much the story that impresses me but the whole antourage surrounding it is phenomenal the soundstage music together in combination with everything on the screen is something you almost never see this was a very special experience in the cinema extremely well done i cant wait for the rd part,positive
175,dune part is cinema pure unbridled cinema it combines blockbuster level polish and action with some of the most thoughtprovoking timely themes in a scifi movie in the past decadethe writing is thoughtful and engaging the acting from everyone is absolutely superb standouts from javier bardem and timothee chalamet the music is stunning and the sound design even more so giant sand monsters have never felt more menacing and explosive action scenes never more raw the cgi is exquisite never once do any of the alien worlds presented feel artificial the best part though has to be the cinematography almost every single shot could be a wallpaper poster or paintingin an age where bigbudget movies are floundering and tired franchises are puttering out dune is bringing crowdpleasing epic movies back i cant wait for the next chapterlong live the fighters,positive
176,choosing not to watch this masterpiece is the greatest disservice you could do for yourself this may be the greatest movie i have ever seen as someone who has never had a vested interest in the world of dune i had my eyes opened in part but denis villeneuves sequel is nothing short of pure captivation hans zimmers soundtrack has not left my head since the movie began the cinematography is some of the most visually stunning across such a variety of scenes austin butler was an absolute force with the little screen time he had a terrifying and psychotic villain that rivals some of the greats timothy chalamets command of attention of all was unmatched the chants of lisan al gaib have replayed over and over in my head for the past day i already have tickets to rewatch and will be shocked if thats the last time i see it,positive
177,from start to finish i was enthralled by the visual experience emotionally i was engaged i was immersed in the world of dune and i definitely want this story to continue to be told through the next book denis villenueve has to be at the helm if they make more the cinematography by greg frazier is awe inspiring the acting is phenomenal hans zimmer killed it with the score when the movie ended i was not ready to be done i wanted more it was a glorious cinematic experienceknowing the book material and growing up with the movie my only hang ups are on some of the choices of what was left out or changed i know not everything can fit into the movie but im still digesting the changes like i said it was an enthralling experience and in some ways they found a very stripped down way of portraying just enough that im not disappointed but i want more but i do stand by this adaptation of part and now part he who controls the spice controls the universe,positive
178,okay wow i saw dune for the first time in the cinema a few weeks ago and fell asleep multiple times i thought it was quite dull and had a huge lack of emotion and the music was incredibly random and loud and so many minutes were wasted on scenery that added nothing to the plotwell dune is nothing like dune dune is filled with plot progress character development action drama and there are almost no minutes wasted and almost everything was executed brilliantly i felt like i was in the cinema for a while but still wouldve prefered it to be double or even triple the length it was just that goodthe only regret is not going to imax movie of the year for sure,positive
179,dune part a movie incomplete in itself was made setting the stage for something bigger though dune did not disappoint it certainly didnt achieve anything greatthe movie starts off fine establishing the characters and where they stand now however the transition of paul accepting the title of lisa al gaib was rather half baked and not convincing he just sees his sister in the future and decides all of a sudden the prophecy etched by his mother and the council which he despised all this time was the only way to go forwardeven the main antagonist at least in some aspects feyd rautha was introduced in a rushed manner and just seemed to exist to create some power dynamic and he was disposed like harkonnens leader when they served no purpose to the story there is no respect for the ploy you build and these villains were just set up to failall in all the story is pretty crude though the cinematography is great and the performances by josh bulin and rebecca ferguson are noteworthy i just think the movie has to many plot holes to fill and only somewhat lives to the hype,positive
180,any one that gives a rating less than lack taste for great movies they are the problem of this world and they never see the good in anythingdune is one of the best movies i have even seen and im an avid movie fan across all genres i will recommend you watch the first part if youve not seen it before or just to get a recap and then go get your minds blown away certain moments will definitely stick with me for a while and the journey timothe took from the start till end of the movie was phenomenal i could barely recognize him and just found myself chanting lisan al ghaib also thanks,positive
181,i had great hopes for dune part two since i really liked the first part but i was left a bit disappointed once again the technical aspect of the production is phenomenal everything is very well crafted direction cinematography production design performances score and it is undoubtedly a big part of the film which has to be recognized and that it saves it for me this is because the narrative part has a lot of issues if the first movie was still slow paced it was able to create an imaginary and become iconic it had the purpose of setting up the second part and i thought some sort of payoff was coming in part two instead even the second movie is all setup with a final battle which lasts like minutes and a very rushed and anticlimactic finale but if the first part took more its time to better justify the characters actions this second part doesnt do that maybe more screen time would have beneficial many times characters do things out of nowhere or because the story needs them but their actions doesnt feel earned and justified in most cases im not saying its all bad and i liked the movie the rating shows that but it could have been so much morethe other issue is that this part two in the end is essentially part one but three years later it has all the same merits and defects it is technically exceptional and it is surely able to impress and foment on the flip side they both were not able to make the viewer empathize much with the characters and the worst thing of all it is once again truncated i accepted it for the first one because it was a build up and because it was the first part of the book but here its bad i get that there is a sequel coming in theory but the story is interrupted once again ive read comparisons to empire strikes back because it was the middle part of a trilogy but the plot of that movie was closed indeed the last shot of episode v is a clear indication of the closure of the story narrated but opening to the fact that something is more to come the final battle is nearing dune part two is instead cut anticlimacticallyunfortunately im pretty disappointed by dune part two which was the movie i was expecting the most this year i liked it but i felt a lot of wasted potential it could have been something truly epic and for the ages instead it has major issues that reduce the impact of the movie itself,positive
182,visually it only breaks down during the overhead scenes when arakkeen is being taken the composits and the firey explosions were rushed and theyre keenly visiblenow onto the meat of it the story it diverges from the book which is fine to do with purpose but thats sorely missing here what purpose was there in that duel if the great houses didnt care one bit for itthe movie went out of its way to make the fremen seem a lot more frenzied and fanatic than they were in the books to the detriment of their humanity and strategic use a bunch of fremen commandeering spacetravelling vessels to carry their jihad into space was as unbelievable as it was nonsensical due to their strong ties to the desert they werent ferried unto other planets to wage war as much as to deal with the overhead armada why would they be capable of doing that even with stolen shipsone of the key takeaways from the book was the authors insights into the ecology of the planet which is absent from both movies although touched upon briefly that goes directly with the reasoning behind the final scene and threat fremen dont need the spice but the entire galaxy does the fremens ultimate goal directly involves affecting spices continued existencethis movie does none of the above and chooses to lean heavily into paul being the lesskeenbutforcedattheslightestprovocation leader of a genocidal cult whose only narrative purpose is to genocide the galaxy as it is said over and over againif you know current day politics you recognize the political undertones even moreso than the day the book was written the west are the great houses paul is the hebrew messiah leading the unwashed and dullwitted hordes into cleaning the world of the oppressorsan insult to the book,positive
183,coming into this film i had the highest expectations leaving this film my expectations were somehow surpassed the characters plot action cinematography sound design every aspect of this film was finely tuned to perfection every scene is masterfully crafted ingrained in my brain the fight scenes were as tense and thrilling as the dune part if not more so the dialogue was engaging the sound effects beautiful and the music was the perfect backdrop to each scene the directors and writers also use silence incredibly well providing stark contrasts to the booming bass that tends to be used in larger fights the characters feel believable and have their own motivations purposes and personalities allowing their relationships to flourish all this without even commenting on the visuals this film is a cinematic masterpiece the cgi and the practical effects being stunning the way the various worlds are portrayed is expertly done absolutely one of the best films i have ever watched would recommend,positive
184,the perfect sequel to a film that sets the stage for the second part dune brings religious and political parallels that allow for a profound reflection on our own society the cinematography soundtrack screenplay and acting performances are simply impeccable i feel that each frame of this film could be used as a photograph in a museum the fascinating and exceptional soundtrack combined with the splendid cinematography immerse me so deeply that i feel like im on arrakis the wellcrafted screenplay ties up loose ends and continues the story in a natural and captivating way thrilling the viewer with each passing minute the performances of everyone involved are brilliant with special mention to the young actor timothe chalamet who portrayed an incredible role as paul atreides with his authoritative voice and leadership demeanor persuading everyone including viewers there is simply nothing to complain about in this second film it embodies cinema at its core dune is one of the most formidable cinematic experiences of the last decades and will forever be one of the best experiences for a lover of good films it will surely become a benchmark for scififiction and for creating an excellent masterpiece dune is absolute cinema,positive
185,this film gave me a taste for cinema villeneuves work is grandiosehans zimmers music sublimates the wholethe actors are all excellent chalamet shows that he is certainly one of the most promising actors of his generationpauls role reminded me of erens place in attack on titans he assumes the responsibility of liberating a people who until then dominated he goes to war against all those who stand up against his will its interesting to see its evolution so fari cant wait to see what villeneuve will offer us in the third part of this saga which is well on its way to place itself among the best saga in cinema,positive
186,dune is a stunning sequel that delivers on the promise of the first part and takes the epic scifi saga to new heights director denis villeneuve has crafted a visually spectacular and emotionally gripping film that explores the themes of destiny power and resistance in a complex and fascinating universethe film picks up where the first one left off with paul atreides timothe chalamet and his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson joining the fremen the native people of the desert planet arrakis who are fighting against the brutal rule of the harkonnen family paul is seen by some fremen as their prophesied messiah the kwisatz haderach who will lead them to freedom and glory however paul is also haunted by visions of a bloody future that he may not be able to avoiddune expands the scope and scale of the story introducing new characters and locations that enrich the worldbuilding and the plot we meet the mysterious bene gesserit sisterhood the powerful emperor shaddam iv christopher walken the cunning feydrautha harkonnen austin butler and the fierce fremen warrior chani zendaya who becomes pauls love interest we also travel to different planets such as the waterrich caladan the industrial giedi prime and the imperial kaitainthe film is a feast for the eyes and ears with stunning cinematography production design costumes and special effects the desert landscapes of arrakis are breathtaking the sandworms are aweinspiring and the space battles are thrilling the film also boasts a phenomenal score by hans zimmer who creates a haunting and immersive soundscape that blends orchestral electronic and ethnic elements the film is best experienced in imax where the sound and the visuals are amplified to create a truly immersive experiencethe film also features excellent performances from the cast who bring depth and nuance to their roles chalamet is superb as paul portraying his inner conflict and his growing charisma and confidence ferguson is equally impressive as jessica who balances her maternal instincts and her loyalty to the bene gesserit zendaya is captivating as chani who shares a strong chemistry with chalamet and adds a touch of romance to the film bardem skarsgrd bautista and butler are also memorable as the fremen leader stilgar the grotesque baron harkonnen the savage beast rabban and the sinister feydrautha respectivelydune is not a film that tries to please everyone it is faithful to the source material by frank herbert which means that it is complex dense and challenging it does not shy away from the dark and violent aspects of the story nor does it simplify the political and religious implications it also does not offer a conventional or satisfying conclusion as it is only the second part of a planned trilogy however for those who appreciate the vision and ambition of villeneuve and herbert dune is a masterpiece that deserves to be seen on the big screen,positive
187,music hans zimmer has done it again another soundtrack given straight from godgraphic i dont know how i dont know why the visual is just pure eye candy everything look beautiful yet intimidating at the same timestory things start to pick up from the first dune yes the first dune is slow burn but everything got a proper paid off in this movie yes this movie ends with a cliff hanger but a lot of thread got resolved in this movie and it is master of class of story writingworld building yeah frank herbert is a master in this field he wrote one of the most affluential book series and this movie did franks work its justice everything is fantastic overthetop but it does make sensenow i need dune right now warner please make it fast you have earned at least ticket from me already for now i will go rewatch it this movie is way too good to just watch it one,positive
188,for me part one was the best movie of the past years and i was afraid part two couldnt keep up with it so i was excited but also afraid to be disappointedafter seeing part two i cant tell whether part two is even better than part one but it is truly an equal masterpiecethe visuals are overwhelming again this time there are even outstanding scenes in black and whitethe sound is captivating and hans zimmer gets the blood flowing again this gives the scenes in almost complete silence a special meaningthe storybuilding is also remarkable you can really see the characters development and also increasing tension between themall in all this movie is the epitome of filmmaking after almost hours i still didnt want it to end some scenes gave me goosebumps and i cant wait to see the next chapter,positive
189,i get making some changes for the screen i get leaving some stuff out expanding some other stuff but the changes fundementally change the story characters their motivations etc and usually for the worse not to mention the plotholes it createsi reread dune minutes after i read the final page i watched both movies back to back while rewatching the first movie i was super hyped i noticed small details i missed the first time i liked the movie even more than the first time despite some of my issues with it eg no dinner party no letter from fenring but for the most part it was a pretty faithful adaptation rewatching it i do see the signs of the story being set up for major change in the second part like how they mention shanis name as desert flower siyaha and chani says i hate it its part of the dumb prophecy siyaha is the pet namehypercorism that paul uses for chani its not her actual name or part of the prophecy but when she said this i knew it was a set up for her much expanded role in the second movie it comes back when chani wakes paul up from the water of life and everyone is like lisan algaib was saved by the desert flowers tears just like in the prophecyanyway the second movie deviates far too much from the books and most of the changes arent good fremen are religiously and ideologically divided the north doesnt believe in the prophecy while the east who they keep calling the fundementalists do so then why dont the tribes in the north use the water esp since theyve tied the water into the prophecy when it wasnt in the books stilgar is the leader of the tabr sietch which is in the north stilgar is from the south why is everyone ok with this guy being their leader wouldnt youth constantly challenge him if they dont believe which means they are just sitting on insane amounts of water for nothing instead fremen refuse to listen to stilgar and challenge him but never to fight for leadership in one scene you have chani standing with a group of young women and some very american looking black bros screaming the prophecy is fake while stilgar is on the other side with a group of bearded middle eastern looking dudes yelling that paul is the lisan al gaib its like theyre saying only these bearded cis brown people believe in this prophecy these hip young girls and bros are too cool for school ps i mention black people because later in the movie they seem to all disappear when they go south there are suddenly no more black fremen paul doesnt get accepted into the fremen after he fights jamis he doesnt take part in jamis water ritual he doesnt get jamis stuff which includes his stepson son and wife haran he doesnt even get his tabr sietch name usul until much later in fact i absolutely detested the scene where paul and jessica reach tabr sietch having the entire crowd chant yell and scream nonsensically it really gives hollywood middle east vibes im turkish and i cringed they cry over jamis threaten paul and jessica etc and claim the dont accept stilgar accepted them theyve proven themselves infront of fremen warriors but as i said stilgar seems to have zero power the whole point is that they dont accept people easily but when they do they see you as part of their group even the sons of jamis are super psyched about having usul possibly the lisan al gaib as their stepdad in the book i did really like that they made paul see jamis as a friend in his prescience but even that sours when they push jamis as this father mentor figure over stilgar stilgar is a worshipper from the start man has barely any doubt stilgar in the book isnt as fanatical he isnt sure that paul is the one but changes as more and more signs reveal themselves and paul gains more and more powers like being able to predict the future and know the past paul laments how stilgar who was once his friend is now just one of his worshippers this change never truly happens in the movie from the very start stilgar without any scepticism is playing the role of the naive brainwashed ultra religious radical who sees what he wants to see he said he isnt the lisan algaib such a lisan algaib thing to say stilgar has to ask a council permission to allow paul and jessica to stay jessica immediately becomes their reverend mother when shes barely been a sayaddina nor even accepted the ritual is completely different the circumstances too and we never get the fremen water of life drug fuelled orgie which im convinced is what inspired the zion party scene in one of the matrix movies the movies time frame is messed up in the books paul spends years with the fremen before the end of the book the movie does all this withing less than months jessica is pregnant at the start still pregnant in the end i get why they didnt add alia i get how impossible it is to have a year old girl run around talk and behave like an adult and even at one point kill people and finish off wounded sardaukar and harkonnen alia believes in the prophecy jessica as a result also believes in the prophecy and she pushes paul to accept the prophecy to drink the water in the book paul choses to drink the water himself secretly to expand his ability to see the future in fact jessica would never approve or advice that in the books in the books jessica is worried about paul becoming more and more of a religious figure the baron is too stoic and silent raban is comically angry feyd never tries to kill the baron instead its the otherway around feyd fighting the undrugged atreides soldier is no longer a thufir hawat feyd plan since thufir is completely gone from the story really dislike the harkonen are all pale white bald guys and the weird easthetic their planet has it kinda looks goofy and empty i get that its geiger esque it just doesnt fit well like when lady fenring goes into her room it resembles an alien machine chamber not a room chani tells paul that stilgar wont teach him how to ride worms because hes not a real fremen but only one in name etc she also claims all fremen are equal they are not sure they are equal as in all can challenge the leader etc but they have leaders and the leaders make the decisions chani is a fedaykin and women among the fremen are all loud mouth boyish warriors fedaykin in the book are a warrior cast that we first hear about when they start acting like pauls devoted radical body guards and personal guardwarriors in the movie paul becomes a fedaykin women among the fremen in the books have very strict roles yes they are strong hardy women yes they can and will fight but they seem to be completely devoted to their husbands and blindly follow their command they dont even argue even if they want to argue they dont talk back etc etcin the book chani is such a wildly different character and id be ok with making chani a bit more independent or strong willed but chani as the one that doesnt accept the prophecy the leader of the anti prophecy people chani as the person that constantly yells the prophecy is fake especially considering that shes in love with paul and we tend to ignore all red flags while in love plus paul fits every part of the prophecy and does a bunch of miraculous things that makes no sense to me in the books a guy comes to challenge paul because he doesnt believe the prophecy chani kills him when paul asks her why she did that she says when the other men find out that those who challenge usul might die by the hands of usuls women they might think twice and avoid the possibile humiliation of being killed by a woman less people will challenge you as a result my love paraphrasing chani also treats jessica with a high degree of respect and formality in the book while in the movie shes constantly being rude to jessica to paul to stilgar etc the guild barely plays a role the most important faction is barely even mentionned chaom is barely mentioned a lot of stuff will happen but then theyll abruptly skip over or forget about it like stilgar makes paul do a trip on his own in the desert but then chani shows up to save him help him do his lone trip in the desert but we never get to see him do the challenge or return to stilgar it just cuts to a whole other scene and circumstance from there paul talks about the fundementalist troops southern troops and makes a distinction between them and the fedaykin the fedaykin are literally fremen qaida they run into death with no fear chanting the name muaddib the fedaykin are all fundementalists in the book fedayin is a word used for irregular rebel bands and guerilla fighters eg its pretty widely used in the muslim world and also among some none muslims people seem a lot more stupid in the movie they will openly talk about secret and or touchy subjects infront of everyone eg gurney for some reason thinks its ok to loudly tell paul that he should make use of this prophecy use the fremen as a tool even if he doesnt believe it etc the only fremen that even reacts to it is chani who is clearly upset at what she hears chani knows the prophecy is a false prophecy planted by offworlders without anyone telling her about it she just knowsi absolutely detested the ending of the movie with everyone going on the jihad while chani remained on her own in the desert i can already see that theyve set chani up to become the anti paul rebel i have a lot more to say but weve reached the character limit it was very well filmed well acted but they ruined the story i get some changes like removing alia since it would be very hard to do alia properly but a lot of the changes are really bad and nonsensicalbook fan score movie fan score,positive
190,i very rarely give ratings to films but dune ii is easily the best movie i have ever seenthis is why you go to the cinema to be entertainednot to be educated or being pressured to think a certain waywhen i go to the cinema and pay for a movie ticket i want quality i want to be taken on a journey very simplelegendary pictures and warner brothers have given denis villeneuve the respect as an artist and as a story teller to allow him to create his vision on the big screen as it should bewhen studios interfere and micro manage projects it dilutes and spoils the quality of the film alien is a perfect example of thisdenis villeneuve hans zimmer jon spaiths and greig fraser are the future of cinemathe hour and runtime just flew by the pacing was spot on i easily could have sat there for and a half hoursthe score by hans zimmer was just unbelievable and perfectly transports you into the world of dune for the entire runtimethe cast and performances were all incredible in particular javier bardem as stilgar he absolutely believed in paul and his journeytimothe chalamet as paul atreides was just awesome i havent seen much of his work prior to dune his performance in part one was more subtle and this film sees him transform intimate a reluctant hero then gradually fully accepting his destiny his speeches to the fremen were incredible and gave me the chillsstellan skarsgrd as the baron just perfect casting absolutely terrifying a highly intelligent and repulsive character very well donethe other stand out performance was austin butler as feydrautha just gave me the creeps anytime he was on screen and totally unrecognisable in the role he is a chameleoni want to see dune and dune prophecy lets make it happenwe need to support films like dune films that are of a high standard are very special and do not come along very oftenticket sales unfortunately are what dictates which films are made and we need to pay to see the films that we want to see at the cinema and stop paying for low quality rubbish filmswe need to vote with our own money for the type of movies that we want to see i am going to see dune again,positive
191,i was very excited about seeing dune part two today i have been waiting for it with expectancy number one was so good that ive watched it half a dozen times because its so much like the book i have only one question and one criticism of this movie why did you have to change the end everything was going along just fine until you changed the ending frank herbert wrote a great story a great book and a great ending and i just dont understand why you needed to change the end its very disappointing and its not worth watching again because its not the story that i am used to so as i said after the kyle mclaughlin version of dune what book did you read because it certainly wasnt dune,positive
192,im one of the few who sees the movie as an ok but not wow factor when i saw part it doesnt click to me at all irregardless im very open to any plot fact or fiction flick and after seeing part i said to myself ill never watch the sequel if it comes out and yes we all now this sequel went out and saw one of the highest reviews given so given a chance to see it as it might flip side my not so good reviews but after seeing the sequel it was the same as the previous one yes visual effects were at its best as always action scenes were great actors were excellent at their acting skills but the plot and its connection for me was still not there if you ask me you may or may not watch the flick,positive
193,i just got home from seeing the movie as a huge fan of the dune universe and having read the original books many times and even many of the brian herbert books i was very happy with this movie except for several plot holes one of which i believe is insurmountablealia pauls sister is supposed to kill baron harkonen and become st alia of the knife in this version she wasnt even born yet chani paul were also supposed to have a child together but that wasnt as important as alias story line there were also some more minor plot deviations but for the life of me i dont know how they make dune messiah or children of dune without st alia i guess well see for non duneheads its definitely an excellent movie,positive
194,part two impressed me in a way ive never been impressed before as expected the visuals were top of the line and the action was spectacularly original part one was a little too slow pacing part two was a little faster paced but so much more interesting and i loved pauls relationship with chani ive seen so many cringy stereotypical and generic romances but theirs was moving i loved how there was so much passion and emotion displayed in their eyes but left out most of the dialogue associated with other romances the emperor may have been the overarching villain but the climactic fight was pauls single combat against feydrautha and that was something the choice to not use music or slow motion shots was atypical but it made for one of the most stressful heartpounding handtohand fights ive ever witnessed as a whole dune part two is one of the greatest movie experiences of my life so just imagine watching it in theaters instead of on a mobile device,positive
195,the movie is the complete cinematic experience i loved every single line every moment every little thing that makes this moviethe only thing that is bothering me is the thirst so bad for the next parti felt like i was in the movie riding a sand worm i was a fremen i felt the pain the wonder the joy the anger this felt like reading the book and you just cant stop the excellence of this movie is not only the cast or the story it is the very making of it i loved every dialogue that was uttered its just a masterpiecethough there is a stagnant pace in between it doesnt seem to matter because most of the second part of the movie is such a cliff hanger,positive
196,dune is what film making should be it nails it with awesome visuals textures and sound backed up by topnotch acting the storys packed with morally complex choices that really make you uncertain what you want from the characters its not just a visual treat its got layers of emotions and is super fun to watch you get pulled into its world feeling every high and low along the ride its a mix of eyepopping scenes deep moments genuine excitement and even laughoutloud moments florence pugh and austin butler are exceptional new additions making it a total hit whether youre in it for the action the drama or the sheer spectacle dune delivers big time,positive
197,the comparison between the two movies and the book is unfair the book is much better than the movies theres no denying that the first part of dune was a reasonable adaptation this second part was a very good adaptation however beyond being an adaptation dune part one was a good movie whereas this dune part two was a very good movieif we stick to the film as an adaptation it will lower its rating but if we focus on the film as a pure and simple cinematic work its a great film and surely if not the best film of the year it will be among the top its a movie to be seen and rewatched in the cinema at least twice its genuinely good,positive
198,it almost never happens but pauls fight with feydrautha actually raised my heartbeat and that was despite knowing how it would pan out music was sublime and definitely a step up even from the masterwork that hans zimmer cooked up for the first part acting was impeccable from the whole cast the action scenes were a joy to behold and the cgi is simply on par with the best looking films out there it is an instant classic and denis villeneuve deserves all the plaudits he will inevitably receive alongside the incredible crew of course definitely one for the big screen unmissable and a truly unforgettable experience timothe chalamet is a revelation in this film his acting is simply incredible he fills every single scene he is in to its absolute brim with his presence rebecca fergus on zendaya and javier bardem are also an absolute delight to watch having watched the part reissue a couple of weeks back meant i was up to date and i could enjoy the plot to the fullest i shall be starting with the books soon enough and i already cant wait for the following film mr villeneuve i sincerely feel like you spoiled us with this film bravo,positive
199,im not going to say much the first part was better this movie added different plot twists but then cut off entire subplots from the book visually stunning but too fast paced normally a fast paced plot keeps you on edge but in this case everything was developed so quickly that you simply moved on to the next plot point im sure their will be plenty of fans especially those that never read the book but imho it was missing something i would dare say it had no heart the movie just seemed to go through the motions eliminate character a and give hisher part to character b check add a plot twist does it make sense who cares check,positive
200,the film starts exactly at the moment the first part ended although according to villeneuve it is designed to be understood without having seen the first part i highly recommend watching dune part one beforethe first half of the film is poetic great shots of the desert developing new characters especially fremen that we had seen briefly in the first part and above all we can see an evolution of some characters that we already knew i highlight here the character of stilgar javier bardem and chani zendaya who undoubtedly gets one of the great performances of the film bravo to villeneuve for having developed chanis character wasted in herberts novel here chani shines until the end bardem is also a fundamental piece that gives freshness to the serious and majestic plot adding dynamism and even funny momentsthe second half of the film goes to paul atreides i cant say too much here only that we see one of the greatest evolutions of a character that ive been seen in cinema the last minutes of the film are simply some of the best i have ever witnessed on a screen everything that was harvested in dune part one now makes complete sense the characters of florence pugh and austin butler stand out the first one in the background but being a totally key character especially for everything that is going to come messiah and the second one for his excellent performance as a villain far above the baron a villain who personally never convinced meall of this is great however an element of equal importance to everything mentioned was the music of hans zimmer spectacular songs and sounds that make you simply feel vibrate literally if you see it in imax every moment inside you it is no coincidence that nolans best films have zimmers seal his music creates art his music creates blockbusters not because its commercial but because it creates emotions within you every note sound and song are placed at the right time and moment in the film hans zimmers music is undoubtedly the specie the water of life of dune part twowith all this we are left with what is not only the best science fiction film ever created but what is be careful what i am going to say the best film of this st century at least to date with permission from the dark knight and interstellarvilleneuve gives us a great masterpiece here however the messiah is not paul atreides nor villeneuve himself the messiah is the spectator you this film will push you to be a better you it will make you dream big it will remind you that like paul you can decide when to lead your life and inspire others you are the chosen one to within a simple movie find the gold that will make you better in your daily lifethis valuable lesson is not achieved by ordinary pieces of art but only by a few works which some of us dare to call masterpiecesbecause in the shadows of arrakis lie one secret dune is a masterpiece,positive
201,dune was novel captivating and you started to form a connection with the characters sadly this was lost in dune whilst the cinematography and music were excellent there was a whiff of an art malik movie about this style over substance there were some brilliant scenes and momentshowever the plot lacked direction was not all that compelling characters lacked development and depth and the film was just too long such that it was a slight relief when it ended such a shame i think it has been overrated i would recommend watching it but go when well rested and feeling patient,positive
202,i really was looking forward to seeing this and i was disappointed completely i read the book i know about the project of jodorowsky and i saw the version of david lynch so i know what dune is aboutthis version had some nice ideas for the cinematography but nothing more timothee chalamet is a complete letdown he has exactly two facial expressions the boyish somehow stupid smile fits for willy wonka not for paul atreides and another look of a freezing disappointed puppy not enough there are scenes wre you desperately wait for him to act but it is all compensated with the massive allwayssoundingthesame score yawn another letdown the new version of feydrautha i don t like sting but he was much more convincing as a madmen while austin butler just treis hard to act one and than there are all those plot holes and illogical scenes the fremen hide under the sand to attack the harvester but after some facetofacecombat they destroy it with laser canon from a long distance why the first assault just to risk lifes stooooopid not even zendaya or xavier bardem were worth watching this pathetic attempt of making a scifimovie id rather return to david lynch and the book,negative
203,i loved this movie it was never boring and the characters were perfectly cast timothy was great as paul there were a lot of fight scenes but they did not ruin the rest of the movie i may end up seeing it a second time fayed was the best looking feyed so far i felt if i has not read the book then i might not have known what was happening to paul via the spice i did miss seeing his sister and i dont quite understand why they changed that even though i read the explanation there are a few movies that i have been looking forward to but this was number one on the list it will be intersting to see how it does at the boxoffice,positive
204,there is something about dune you either dig it or you dont i dig it in fact i love itdune came out as a novel in it is set in the mind bogglingly distant year of ad ten thousand years after mankind has overthrown the intelligent machines it createdthe demon of ai has already been conceived and defeated so unlike a lot of scifi this story is about people and not about their clever machinesit could easily have been set during the crusades it has grandeur it is expansive it is complexit is about belief and faith it is full of religious fervour about survival against the odds it is also about revenge and justiceit is about careful manipulation sowing the seeds of prophecy nurturing it of plans that span generations about knowing when to seize the moment when that time finally comesbut at the same time it is about a hero fully aware of what destruction that may bringdune is influentialif youve watched the star wars films dunes reluctant hero living on a desert planet with a looming empire and the battle for the galaxy will feel familiar after the success of the first star wars film lucas termed himself too big to suei have read dune many times i have watched the david lynch film more times than i can remember in fact i have watched dune part one about five timesthe casting in this version is perfect the effects are impressive and on the big screen the sound immersive and there is some really quite striking imagerydune has almost become a holy book for the scifi fan of a certain age it even has a messiah i am that kind of fan watching it has become a religious experience you feel like you are watching the prophecy you know so well come true that makes it powerfulthat makes dune part two simply superb,positive
205,i watched the part one back at its realise and it was a very nic exiting exciting experience the scenario had a mystery nice characters and acting the movie ends and you stay with questions and mystery the part two requires you to watch the first the scenario continues where the part one ends with the same tone and the amazing for me backroung sound and music especialy in the cinema the certain thing is that the part two doesnt disappoint in any section i thing that only improves and when i mean improve i dont say in technical terms but the viewer appreciate even more the scenario the characters every spectrum of the film thats because you start to be more familiar and you start to like that you have a bigger picture on the lore dont mistaken me the first part in my opion it was at the same level of quality as the second both movies awesome and the mystery on what happens next even at the same scene is there and it does it nice i think that with this movies warner bros bring back a franchise who deserve movies like this and i am very glad that i watched them both they deserve your time dont miss them the cgi effects was clean like clean,positive
206,dune part ii is a film of superlatives simply phenomenal introduced by the guttural spoken prayer of the sardaukar priests familiar from the first part the second scene once again leads into the vastness of the desert and the spherical sounds while watching the grains of sand flying over the desert ceiling herald the epic start of the following two and a half hourswith dune part ii the best in their field come together to film what is largely unfilmable added to this is villeneuve and zimmers personal dedication to the original book and their close collaboration with herberts descendants whats really brilliant is that the film succeeds in explaining the very complex history of the universe which even in the books cannot be understood without a glossary in such a way that the inexperienced viewer understands the plot coherently and the experienced viewer recognises the subtle allusions the usual challenges of science fiction films are solved well some questions are simply not allowed to be asked as is typical of the genre such as how to descend from shaihulud analogous to why didnt the eagles fly to mordor anyone who is petty here does not understand the metaphor of fantasyfrom the very first minute you are captivated by this galaxy created by herbert which villeneuve and fraser and many others design with visual magnificence supported by the inimitable acoustic support from zimmer the entire film crew pushed themselves to their limits and sometimes you only recognise the masterly craftsmanship at second glance my third cinema is at doorstep still counting just to mention the infrared scene on giedi prime the novel and different sounds of the various planets the voice of loire cotler the performance of the real actors in the real desert the clever use of mass psychological rhetoric and the entire costume and set designthe film is a holistic work of art whose atmosphere and pathos simply overwhelm me and either leave me speechless or elicit minutes of praise but it could be a little longer because so much is only hinted atyet my favourite film,positive
207,so frank herbert told a story of religious fervor and how it warps the minds of people dennis villeneuve wanted to capture it and did so very wellwith this film villeneuve creates a grand tapestry of cultural expression which we have never seen before the different planets have their very distinct feel to them in both sight and sound and one never feels like its too much or too weird its just the right amount villeneuve managed to capture and create his own totality of the world of dune some could say he leaves certain parts of the book out which they miss but just as with peter jacksons trilogy this movie eminates a passion from both director cinematographer composer vfx artists sound designers its clear they wanted to tell frank herberts story and they certainly didhollywood is in a crisis why just because people have stopped going to the movie theatres well as we see with this movie which has already broken many box office records people havent necessarily stopped going to the cinema they just dont wanna waste money on bad movies so the hollywood crisis is sure partly due to technological change but also to a severe lack of good stories to tell and funnily enough the lack of stories to tell in has a parallel to the story of dune mainly in that the prophet of paul atreides is precisly the story the fremen need to reach beyond the dunes and out into the galaxy we need a similar story to reach beyond ourselves today too but as dennis villeneuve and frank herbert so brilliantly shows us it can very easily go badi tell you though when watching this film you cannot help yourself you are just dragged along whether you want to or not chalamet bardem ferguson zendaya skarsgrd butler they all do their parts so well i would say zendaya has a tendency to be in the permanent i carelessly dissaproverole but even she manages to break out of it for this moviethe thing that impressed me the most is the authenticity of the different cultural expressions as i mentioned before the harkonnen aestethics the choice of having a black and white sun the fremen funeral rite the accuracy of shamanic rituals the costumes it all feels like a window into a different reality more than a moviei have blabbed on what could have been said in just a few words so here it goes in case i wasnt clear this is an amazing movie,positive
208,the film was an absolute masterpiece leaving me in awe from start to finish every aspect of it was meticulously crafted showcasing the immense talent of the cast and crew the captivating storyline drew me in keeping me on the edge of my seat with its twists and turns the performances by the actors were truly outstanding bringing the characters to life with depth and authenticity the lead actor delivered a breathtaking portrayal perfectly capturing the essence of the role the visuals were stunning with breathtaking cinematography that transported me to the films rich and immersive world the production design and special effects were topnotch creating a visually striking and believable environment the films score was a true standout enhancing the emotional impact of each scene it skillfully blended with the narrative elevating the overall experience the pacing was spoton keeping me engaged throughout and leaving me wanting more the films director showcased an exceptional vision crafting a cinematic marvel that will undoubtedly stand the test of time its a remarkable achievement that will leave a lasting impression on audiences in conclusion this film is a true gem and i highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates masterful storytelling exceptional performances and a visual feast for the senses its an absolute mustsee for film enthusiasts and fans alike and i cant wait to revisit this extraordinary piece of cinematic brilliance,positive
209,initially the film attacks the goals of the top of the filmography with the quality of the scenes the set the costumes and also working with the atmosphere the actors are convincing and the environment even if generated in places is incorporated so that it is almost imperceptible however where the films problem arises is in the dramaturgy working with film time is not goot at all the movie sequences dont always fit together and the closer we get to the end the more problems there are in this area in some places the tension is cut off and then the tension is missing and the logic of the characters actions begins to hide the worst thing is exactly the feeling of watching a movie its great that the film captures and hits but it cant sustain interest all the time without problems just the fact that the viewer asks what time it is and how long it takes in the cinema he notices the people around him and has to literally struggle to keep watching when the real world starts talking to him through the illusion of the screen thats a failure as the film moves forward and nears the end it becomes boring the dramaturgy and the position of the characters in the story their value for the story completely collapses towards the end and is saved only by the vision of a possible sequel well its not exactly a bad movie but as a whole it lacks a pull at goal,positive

212,i love it theres something special about this cinematic experience that brings back the nostalgia of the early s when the best movies came out its a time when anticipation built up for months if not years before a major films release i particularly enjoy that its once again similar like back in the days when you were genuinely excited to await a movies release the kind of excitement that had you marking calendars and planning movie nights with friends or family as a hardworking man finding joy in such simple pleasures has become rare i can enjoy a trilogy again as if i were a fan just like in the old days finding myself in a world so vast and stories so compelling that for a moment the outside world fades away it makes me feel young again reigniting the sense of wonder and endless possibility i had back then this movie is brilliant not just in its execution but in its vision i love how they incorporated islamic prophecies its a testament to the films commitment to not just entertain but to educate and i believe this movie is more than just fiction and entertainment its the future,positive
213,we just saw it today and i have to say i enjoyed every moment i missed seeing a movie worth the trip to a cinema and i have lived throughout every moment of itthey did justice to the book it is so beautifully filmed and created and the music complements every scene they also managed to send the correct messages from the book who are still so valid or even more important nowadays and to be fair the young cast also rose to the occasion and did well for their characters it was beautiful to watch and impressive to hearone might say it feels too slow paced at some point but it is for a good reason and what comes next is explosive i love it,positive
214,the perfect movie doesnt exis dune made me feel nostalgia so badly for a time i never lived im so in love with the way it made me feel excited and anxious and amazed in every litle frame and im sure this movie would never be the same without zimmerthe scenes where chani gets emotional without saying anything shows how phenomenal zendaya is who cries with their chin like thatalso i thought that timothe evolved a lot as an actor and the third act was breathtaking because of iti loved how the bene gesserit plot shows us a side of the story that resembles real life i loved the way it all became very tangible,positive
215,usually im not going to cinema i prefer quiet atmosphere at home and fact that i can pause a movie at any time i want to for the frist time in while i make an exception for dune part two and im not regret any moment of those two and half hours of masterpiece which definitely is dune part two im in love with this movie this is perfection incredibly balancing between dialogues and action music in this movie was also hans zimmer really knows how to match those instruments with scenes that we see next part is acting and oh boy timothe chalamet and austin butler were my favorites i dont know what else should i say this movie was just perfect in every aspect,positive
216,tis movie was great although not without its flaws but even whith them it dosent take you out of the experience the atmosphere is ameazing and you feel like you are in the world of arrakis again this movie is not pervect but the flaws arent big enough that you cant look past them all the actors did an amazing job and even the beckground characters did there all the music in the movie was one of my favourite parst because it fits perfectly in to the world and help you get immersed even more i think that the languages where implemented really well to the point where i can see it being an actual language like i said this movie is not pervet it has its flaws i feel like a lot of the ideas could have been explored more and i wish we could have seen more ot the desert an the south of arrakis its a genuinely fun and great movie and i cant recommend it enough,positive
217,whoever says film is dead show them this i cant believe what i witnessed tonightim not a big movie person i do love movies but havent reviewed or criticized any of them i just cant stop thinking about this movie how good every single actor did to portray their rolethe way the director made sure everything was perfect and just visually spectaculari have nothing bad to say about this film the sound was perfect the sights i noticed my eyes expand to their fullest at most of these scenes i had to remind myself to blinki hate reviews like this because i feel others may feel im exaggerating but watch this film for yourself and tell me im wrong,positive

219,my mouth was left wide open at many points in the film this movie rivals interstellar the visuals were even better than the first film and the acting was incredible what is a hour minute film felt like an hour and a half to me the storyline along with the otherworldly music grips you in from the very beginning a perfect sequel to dune part one in that its so different to part one but the stakes seem much higher i will be seeing it again tomorrow after seeing it this evening which is rare for menow we can only hope this film does well enough to justify a production of dune messiah,positive
220,i went into this with big hopes i was waiting for my day off of work to specifically see this at the cinema on imaxdune for me is within the top greatest scifi movies i say scifi because it was futuristic ie with greater technology which for me results in scifidune was immense as an imax experience no doubt the explosions were awesome etc however where dune disappointed me was the fight scenes the bipolar characters specifically bautista the group fight scenes army battles etc and what ill refer to as the choreography was poor and you could see the actors waiting to be struck and it looked fake and ruined the credibility bautista in dune was frightening and dark where in dune he was a blubbering idiot also the role played by austin was okay but the fact he needed the shield to fight crippled atreidas was confusing to me cos if austins character is such a badass thenmy understanding of what is a scifi has been changed and from now on not only does it need technology but also a higher level of intelligence rather than a marketedportrayed high level of intelligencealso the element of comedy in dune which i like but not in scifis made it into an actionadventure and there were indiana jones vibes in part from the yemen sorry the fremen bardem was a few lines away from saying indyin a nutshell dune was a dark and relatable movie spice oil etc etc it was magnificent and if dune batman begins then dune batman robinfor me this is overrated it is good but not very very goodzendaya was goodchalomet was goodbardem was goodferguson was goodi wanted more and started falling asleep once the fight choreography ruined the credibility of what i expected to be a top top movie,positive
221,its a teen romance drama masqueraded as a scifi movie from the hour runtime hours are close up shots of zendayas face like in soap operas i saw this movie a few days ago and have already forgotten most of it people who have rated this as a have most likely forgotten how actual s make you feel those movies stay in your mind for a long while i mean movies the alien blade runner even a little never movies like district dune is not even close to those in any category its a sad fact a great scifi epic is reduced to the most simplest form and theyll be making at least two sequals i will not spend any money on those nor should you,positive
222,dune part is nothing short of a spectacular cinematic experience the score is on another level hans zimmer takes what you already know and makes it even more impactful you have to experience it on big screen with sounds completely overflowing and captivating you the cast is simply perfect unforgettable performances from rebecca ferguson javier bardem and timothee chalamet as a huge fan of the books i say they made them justice this is a fantastic adaptation of frank herberts world whatever they changed they did a good job with it and it all makes sense some things just wouldnt work on screen and you all know it no spoilers though go and see it films like this come rarely,positive
223,i mean if you were to sum up humanity in one movie this would be itso layered and nunanced in the deep topics it explores yet it communicates this through a visual and visceral soundscapei havent had such an immersive movie experience like this since interstellar and that was up there until now as one of the best films made in my opinionnot only are we lucky to have one goat film maker alive at this moment in time but we have two simultaneously in villeneuve and nolanhaving finished the book about an hour before my first screening this evening i was apprehensive in how the story would be translated visually due to its complexity but it blew past all my expectations and then sumthis is the result of having the best of the best in their respective fields coming together to produce a masterpiece be it in frasers cinematography zimmers sound scape or the costume set design and vfx departments acting writing and directing at the highest calibredo yourself a favour and watch this on the big screen imax dolby atmos to capture the true effort gone into creating this work of art and to do it justice it will go down in our history as one of the greatest films ever made,positive
224,dune part is an absolute marvel of a movie and zendayas performance as chani is just magical she brings such depth and emotion to the character making chani feel like a real person you can root for and connect with her chemistry with timothe chalamet is off the charts and you can feel the tension and tenderness between them in every scene they sharezendayas presence on screen is captivating and you cant help but be drawn into her world shes not just an actress playing a role she becomes chani embodying her strength courage and vulnerability in a way thats truly inspiringand lets not forget the rest of the movie the visuals the storytelling everything is just topnotch director denis villeneuve has created a breathtaking world that feels both epic and intimate and zendayas performance is a shining beacon in the midst of it alloverall dune part is a cinematic experience you wont soon forget and zendayas talent and charisma only add to its brilliance shes truly one of the brightest stars in hollywood right now and i cant wait to see what she does next,positive
225,im so grateful that i had the chance to see one of my favorite book series coming to life in this astonishing way the whole length of the movie my eyes was in tears and i had the urge to get up from my chair and get involved in the storythe visuals and soundtrack kept me in a dreamlike state almost all the whole movie the cast was perfect for each character i really believe them special mentions to stilgar and feyd rautha i think they deserves some big rewards for their great performanceeven if you didnt read the books this movie will take you in a place youve never been before dare to take this amazing ride and go see it youll thank me later,positive
226,dude is a pillar of science fiction and to see it done this well especially in a climate of relatively subpar cinema has been nothing less than thrilling to watchbook readers will come away satisfied and even with our nitpicks with the changes theyve had to make from turning a large complex novel like dune into a two hours and minute movie i was delighted with the tweaks they made these changes not only helped make the story more coherent to a casual audience but also highlighted some character motives without having to dive too deep into other plotlinesfor those were just looking to see a wellmade piece of cinema you will not be disappointed its a visually stunning emotionally gripping and well crafted cautionary tale on charismatic leadersdenis villeneuve take a bow this is the kind of movie that comes around once every years or so,positive
227,after years of terrible sciif action films mainly by disney we get a movie that lives up to its hype dennis villanueve has done it hes created an scifi action film that does everything right by the end of the film the entire theater was silenced in awe the acting from zendaya to chalamet and brolin was fantastic my only complaint is i wish the final battle scene was a bit longer it felt too short but im nitpicking go out and spend your hard earned money this film was meant to see on the big screen this is truly a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time will be watching again very soon,negative
228,the movie was descent scifi and a fairly good second part to the series the character build wasgood but not great the dialog left something to be desired as it was at times confusing if you didnt know the story the cinematography was excellentall that being said i cant for the life of me understand why the writers and directors feel in todays world that they have to change the original story line the modifications done actually did major changes to the story in a way that made it lose continuity and not make sense in parts the leaving out of specific caracter interactions such pauls sister killing the baron and pauls ability to use the voice to say nothing of skiping the whole sonic weapon storyline was crazy chantis lack of support for pauls descision to marry emperors daughter was weird chani not having a son was also strange as it played a big part in pauls descision makingall in all the tone and storyline of the second part was as if this was a totally different movie and story from the first part,negative
229,to be honest this is one of the best movies i have ever seen in years denis villeneuve couldnt have done it better the buildup for the main idea of the movie was unbelievable how he planted the idea of the movie in the back of our mind was out of this world this only happens when you take care of the least of the details we can see in this movie how denis made sure that he didnt waste any detail the amount of details in the movie can be compared to the greatest movies ever made everything was on point the designs of the locations were outrageous the accent difference between the northern and southern people of arakkis the clothing to be honest everything was on point the outrageous buildup made the conclusion very glorious and we cannot wait to see dune part thank you denis for this masterpiece,positive
230,i loved the first movie what happened with the second for those who read the booksfirst what happened to the space guild navigators one of the main plots is that the space guild navigators need spice to fold space and allow travel between the systems no where to be found in this movie so for those who didnt read the books spice comes across as a drug used like cocaine in the movie you have no sense of urgency because if the spice must flow is stopped its the end of the empiresecond what a waste of of christopher walken he comes across as the enfeebled emperor of the houses the urgency for the emperor going to dune is because he doesnt want paul to tell the other houses about his betrayal what i guess since you didnt bring in the space guild navigators you had to invent another reason did christophers contract stipulate that he only wears robes or did they run out of money for his costumes at the end of movie he looks like a homeless person walked on set what was also missing was the pressure by the witches and the space guild on the emperor to continue with spice production christopher was less menacing and more like grandpa needs to go to the memory care facilitythird i knew the movie was in trouble when i looked at my watch and realized theres only nine minutes left in this move how are they going to end it i felt the movie was rushed to reach a conclusion and the ending battle was chaotic and short chaotic in not a good way there is a whole scene about the atomics that made me question on why is it in the movie we are told about the atomics but there is no followup to the ending battle the fierce emperor warriors come across as incompetent wimps the ending seemed way to rushed its less about a powerful emperor and more like how did none of the other houses not take him outthere are other problems that are pretty minor like nothing is mentioned at all about the other systems like the mentats or the planet of machines too much time spent on fade killing people in an arena but failing to mention who these characters are if you hadnt seen the first film there deaths make no sense robands death seemed like an after thought like we need to get rid of this character but the movie is going on too long but my primary complaint is the lack of space guild navigators and why spice is so important to these people there seems to be no urgency by any of the characters to make sure the spice must flow disappointed,positive
231,i see quite a lot of positive reviews here from younger audiences it seems dune struck a cord in all born after which i guess is a good thing calling it the best movie of all time is something else it means you first have to watch all films of all time to make such a bold assessment and secondly villeneuves rendering needs to be something special it is notthere has been other and better movies displaying the same story line scenes and composition sorry to disappoint you genzers or beloweven frank herbert confest himself to be inspired by lawrence of arabia now this film is one you need to see no sand worms there unfortunatelythe storyarch and intrigues are also not new even cliche the highrise hero falling for the lowly dame and ultimately dump her nothing new but dune will show something different apart from the well orchestrated mass fight and one on one fight scenes we have seen way to often this movie has very little to offer there really is no suprise only quite a lot of wasted talent on rampling and walker those are boomers btw there is no surprise no novelty in this movie it is a boring arrangement of boring repeats even hans went back to a repetition of what we have heard before interstallar that was truy awesomeif you want to see a movie in the desert go watch lawrence of arabia if you want to see a messias go watch matrix if you want to see a good sci fi movie go see ehm,positive
232,i first watched the original dune when i was around and was a little nervous when they announced a reboot then i watched it and fell in love with the beautiful set designs the sfx and the choreography a long with the more faithful approach to the story i found out afterward that a sequel was greenlit only days after the first ones release and was hyping myself up for the movie it did not disappoint i havent cried in a theater since endgame but during the final battle sequence it was too beautiful and spectacular not to seeing a film of one of my favorite novels of all time being adapted in such an incredible way was heart wrenching to say the least the greatest science fiction movie of all time i will wait oh so patiently for the third,positive
233,i loved the first movie even though it slowly built the plot i am familiar with all the dune books and was happy with how it was done this second movie though is on another level altogether just been to the cinema to see it with friends and we were all overwhelmed definitely this will be the best movie of this year maybe of this decade some slight changes from the books but i can understand why they were made and i think they add to the filmthis is a complex film that works on so many levels all of us would happily have watched it again immediately there are so many small details and elements to lovedo yourself a favour and go to the conema and see thisi think the third film may not be so good as the third book not so great being set years after the ending of part when paul is on power for some time but i am still looking forward to itpeople are comparing this film to dark night and empire strikes back that is not hype i agree despite game of thrones being inspired by frank herberts dune and sharing many themes and despite similarities used by lucas in star wars if anything the plot elements work even better here in the priginal,positive
234,dune part two masterfully continues the epic saga seamlessly blending spectacle with profound storytelling denis villeneuves direction remains impeccable capturing the essence of frank herberts universe timothe chalamets portrayal of paul atreides deepens navigating complexities with skill the visuals astound matched by hans zimmers evocative score a gripping sequel that elevates the scifi genre and personally i cant wait three more years for part three because this could be my favorite movie ever one thing is absolutely sure dune part two is a better movie than the empire strikes back,positive
235,paul atreides unites with chani and the fremen while seeking revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the universe he must prevent a terrible future only he can foreseeid like to start off by mentioning that i didnt really like the first dune i felt like it was too slow and lacked significant events and was just setting up this part looking back now i understand why that was the case this part wouldnt have been as good without the setup from part one the first scene in this movie is really visually beautiful and sets up the tone for the rest of the film the movie is a hour adventure in this incredible world were time just flys by the production was fabulous and the action and fight scenes were super entertaining big credits to the director denis villeneuve hans zimmers score is also a big selling point of the movie as it elevates the watching experience and changes the viewers mood the cast is also perfect and you can sense that theres a strong chemistry between all of the actors the story is incredibly good but the storytelling could be a bit better there are some points that leave you with question marks but maybe that is left to be explained later which brings me on to the next point i need closure this film seems like its also setting up a next film so thats more than five hours of set up with the durations of part one and two combined with no clear end or a bit of closure i get that this is supposed to be a big scifi film series but there has to be a point of where i feel like i didnt spend hours on a journey with no sense of ending hopefully they change my mind regarding this point by the time dunepart three releases other than that it was an absolutely amazing film that has to be watchedscore,positive
236,not since lord of the rings have i been so enthralled by a movie i couldnt wait until i was able to review itthe acting the story telling the scenery the philosophies and human nature its so encapsulating i was catching myself being so immersed i forgot i was watching a moviethe continuation of paul atreides story happens at a perfect pace new characters are introduced in a way that makes you care just enough about them to make it impactful the telling of the stories of the bene gesserit is done masterfully conveying stuff from the book that is hard to put on screenif there was one thing i was missing its the use of the word holy war instead of the book accurate holy jihad but i suppose thats just something they have to changethis is a out of if there ever was one,positive
237,i dont normally write any reviews but this i feel i mustwathced this movie at twilight hours only time i can get my hands on in bfi imaxwatching movies for over years and i have to say this is probably one of my best cinema experiences everjust simply wow wow wow wowi loved every minute of it its so powerful i think this director gained enough experience to make something exceptionali have not read the books so i cant say if it stayed true or not but it doesnt matter to me the whole sequal is so entralling than the first of course i do like the first part the pace was spot on didnt feel the movie was long in anywaysoudtrack super especiall in bfi imax as it made my blood pounding as it did with the movieintense experience and in the end while i was walking to the car i told my son at no stage in the movie that i felt anything was cheesy or forced it was just perfect,positive
238,this is certainly a great looking film to see on a big screen with some really effective almost industrially sounding audio but what happened to the story its wafer thin and really stretched out for hours we pick up with paul timothe chalamet and his mother rebecca ferguson trying to convince the fremen that they are worth the hassle fortunately leader stilgar javier bardem is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give jessica a chance to prove her own worth and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her sons ascendant propheteering all of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on chani the underused zendaya and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new duke meantime now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative guinness the evil baron harkonnen an almost zeppelinlike stellan skarsgrd has recruited his lethal nephew feydrautha austin butler to get to grips with the rebellion on arrakis that is bringing him into the gaze of an illsatisfied emperor christopher walken battle lines are drawn now whilst i did enjoy this the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of khartoum and lawrence of arabia with a bit of the phantom menace thrown in for good measure the acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go i was convinced this this was but part two of three or maybe even more walken and charlotte rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference indeed even zendayas warriorlike tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and i though that chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round that said it does work well enough as a classy and well produced scifi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but i needed more meat on its bones i still get distinctly squeamish when i watch what they do with the water let alone where they get it from,positive
239,i watched the first dune film shortly before dune was released and was instantly hooked by the story but seeing dune in imax was honestly the greatest sensory cinema experience ever the score the cinematography the rhythmic editing the acting all just fantastic i wasnt a scifi person before but this film made me a fan it was the best movie by far ive seen at cinema in a long time i would watch this film again and again and again if youre thinking of seeing this film i highly recommend it in imax the thumper sounds are epic and the sheer scale of the world just go see it,positive
240,dune part two comes out in a historic moment where world feel the need of a new kolossal movie while every other big scale franchises are doomingunfortunately pauls epic tale suffers of incredibly slow pacing cuts and slow character building sequences imagine it takes one hour to get out of the become the messiah chapter i liked the direction and the choice to cut meaningless chatting over a bigger direction with the world showing the events dialogues are often over filled with high fantasy terms and nomenclatures which im sure will lose the audience many times before you understand you dont actually need to understand what they mean to get the bigger picturecasting is probably one of the greatest i have ever seen with many having just a few lines of dialogues andor not feeling invested in the characters they are portrayingi cant stand bautista to be the main villain for the first part of such a moviejust to be replaced by a random dude with no charm that does a badass showoff for minutes and become our tier s final bossworld wants villeneuve to be the new peter jackson so hard with articles and adv everywhere over the net calling it the new empire strikes back but this dune is a poor contender when put in comparison to any lord of the rings,positive
241,what is it about screenwriters that makes them believe they can rewrite a story better than the original author the visuals are stunning in this film and it would have been exceptional if not for the departure from the original writing as a result the story became shallow and yet another burning torch for gender equality in film what a shame if you have read the books you would know that chanis character for example is a complete departure in this film the character backstories in some cases are non existent i pity the new generation of film goers who watch this without ever having read the books as they are missing out on a truly great story,positive
242,i watched the movie on the premier day in imax and i was completely stunned by the movie it is by far the best movie i have watched the music the sounds the costumes the acting the costumes the character development is absolutely amazing i just watched the movie for a second time in a regular family friendly cinema and i just have to say that the expereince wasnt the same i still got the chills but the intensity you get from this movie in imax is not comparable to anything i have ever seen i cannot urge you enough to watch this in imax and be prepared to get addictet to what is imo the best movie off all time,positive
243,dune part delivered in every way on what part began and served as an artfully brilliant adaption of the source material frank herberts dune is my favorite book of all time and i was more than pleased with the translation to the screen that denis villeneuve masterfully put together the scenery worldbuilding character development music sound effects pacing and overall feeling in my opinion perfect for this story there were a few changes from the book that made the story easier to digest on screen which i felt was appropriate and made the movie better than it would have been had it directly adapted every detail of the booki especially loved this movies depiction of pauls internal struggle with a desire for revenge while at the same time growing love for chani and the fremen people he is clearly stuck in the middle of expectations controlled prophecies love loss and fear of greater loss and suffering all of this internal turmoil is heard in pauls words tone and seen on his face lady jessicas portrayal is terrifying and unsettling chani is the heartbeat of the story and allows the audience a figure to connect with and respond to the events of the film with stilgar is devout and unironically hilarious at timesevery shot of the movie is a work of art i plan to go back for a nd viewing,positive
244,it is such a relief to finally see a movie on the scale of the dark knight or other greatsthe acting direction sound design score and visuals are top class and all come together to complete a modern epicsure some of the book purests will disdain the film for verging of the some of the original narrative and others who thought dune was boring will probably think the same for thisthis movie significantly expands the first movie while having some of the most intense action scenes i have seen plus the political and religious undertones advance the storyline so much more than anything star wars could have envisionedguess its only fair since dune influenced star wars and if you are a fan of game of thrones this will be right up your alleybut overall this is a special masterful moment in movie making and scifi bring on dune messiah,positive
245,its truly refreshing to experience a bigbudget blockbuster in theaters where the director is given creative freedom without being suffocated by studio interferencedenis villeneuve was clearly able to bring his vision to life in this second installment of dune and what a success it is similar to the first film the sound and visuals are stunning with the colors in many scenes leaving me utterly speechlessthis movie features significantly more action and fighting which is understandable given that the first film focused on establishing the environment and explaining the world of dunei particularly appreciated how pauls visions were integrated into the story as well as the exploration of the various religious themes without giving away spoilers although i havent read the book i felt that villeneuve did an excellent job of translating the complex themes from the source material onto the screen,positive
246,one of the best movies ive ever seen true to scifi dark intense amazing cinematography quality acting and with exciting action i still find it hard to believe that a movie with so much in it is so well put together as well im quite surprised that its received so much mainstream buzz because it partially feels like a real scifi movie if that makes any sense but i can understand how theres enough here to appeal to all fans of cinemaits an instant classic for me it actually surpassed dune part one and delivered on all fronts part one did a great job at setting the scene and part two knocked it out of the park i would give it a because its a bit long and theres a lot to follow throughout the entirety of the movie it can get a bit taxing loved this movie,positive
247,i will not be afraid of this word this is the best film i have seen the director the cast the script and everything else it deserves all the oscars this yearwhen i went to the cinema for the first time i received very positive emotions when i went for the second time it seemed to me that the film sags a little during the second act but at the same time the last hour looks very good when i went for the third time i did not notice any flaws the third time i watched it with maximum pleasure i have already bought a ticket to go for the fourth time i want to note especially the love line of paul and chani i was moved to the bones also the music it is simply incredible i am extremely delighted with the fact that what hans zammer wrote for this film great work go to the cinema and enjoy if possible better in imax,positive
248,dune part two the highly anticipated continuation of denis villeneuves adaptation of frank herberts classic novel builds on the foundation set by its predecessor the film picks up the story of paul atreides timothe chalamet as he navigates the treacherous political landscape of arrakis while embracing his destiny among the fremenvisually dune part two is a masterpiece villeneuves direction combined with greig frasers breathtaking cinematography immerses viewers in the vast unforgiving desert landscapes and the intricate otherworldly design of the dune universe the special effects are seamless bringing the sandworms and the unique technology of herberts world to life with stunning realismthe performances are strong across the board with chalamet delivering a compelling portrayal of pauls growth and struggle zendayas expanded role as chani adds depth to the narrative and the supporting cast including rebecca ferguson and oscar isaac continue to shinehowever the films pacing can be uneven and its complex plot might be challenging for those unfamiliar with the source material despite these issues dune part two is an ambitious and visually arresting film that successfully continues the epic saga its a mustwatch for fans of the genre and the original novel,positive
249,this movie is just fun to watch all the details give the fremen a soulyes it left some stuff from the book out but it also added thingsyou can see the true nature of the fremen apart from fierce fighting female characters like lady jessica and chani gain importance which they really deserve due to the movies rather slow pace you can really feel how fremen fanatics draw paul out to be their messiah and through chani and paul you can see that they initially dont need a white male savior because they are strong themselvesoutside of arrakis however you see how much paul muad dib is underestimated they already try to find another puppet for their game feyd rautha a total mad man who really shows his sardistic sidethe movie is an homage to the books each actor portrayals their role beautifully so that they feel really like their characterthe cinematography obviously is a special touch a feeling of amazement and passion for arrakisthe score only adds to that makes you feel the worldin my eyes it is perfect to understand and just coolavoiding the difficulties in portraying alia by just postponing her birth cutting the space guild cutting hawat turfirs little arc or the intrigues of the baron and the nabaron all of these things gave more space to the fremen and that really paid out,positive
250,opening for part three most important parts of the story are in min of the min movie unexplained and vague unconvincing characters first part was excellent unlike this one for someone who is fan of the book and david lynch dina from this is big disappointment his transformation was covered in min from taking his position as rebel leader to conqueror of the universe in min love story is the love story is unconvincing and without any chemistry between the two leading characters all in all a big disappointment after the successful and good first part you can watch this film at home with no problem,positive
251,dune part here to accept the award is director denis villeneuvedenis tell us what was your goal for this moviewell i wanted to make another movie with lots of sand in it many sands much cinematographyand how did you see the story progressing from the first moviewell there needed to be more sand sand and giant worms of coursewhat do you say to those who criticize the use of spice as a standin for todays drug problemswell i wanted as well as the sand for there to be chemistry in the film spice chemistry so of course i had to make sure there was no chemistry between the two main actors that might have overshadowed thatsome have said that the film is overly long and badly paced can you commentwell sand cant be rushed as for pacing well i certainly did a lot of that in the editing roomand what of hans zimmers interesting scorewell it was magnificent who doesnt like an obvious tribal theme with lots of wailing voices that make no sensesome complain it is boring thoughtswell the worms certainly bore through the sand did you see that many worms much sandthere are those that say you cherrypicked things from the book and didnt follow the original story accuratelywell there was a bookokay well thank you for your time mr villeneuve enjoy your winwell i think i shallsummary sand spice no chemistry some action minutes of unecessary footage that could have been cut by the time part comes out you will have forgotten this dont be tempted to rewatch it,positive
252,a movie of grace and beauty a faultless sequel to a complex and challenging story denis villenvuve had joined the pantheon of great scifi directors he understands the source material and brings to life a book that requires so much to do the actors all excel under his vision and they embody their characters with absolute convictionthe lighting and cinematography is of the highest standard and it should result in many wins at the award seasoni eagerly look forward to the next installment and i am very happy to give this movie ten stars its a tremendous piece of cinema and everyone should go see it on the big screen,positive
253,dune part is a literal masterpiece everyone gave a performance of a lifetime the action is grand and epic the hand to hand combat is fast paced the cinematography and vfx are the best ive seen writing and storytelling are at its finest the score and sound effects are beautiful and loud this movie is super immersive the stand out are timothee zendaya and austin butler pacing is perfect as you are super immerse in the movie that you lost the sense of time watch this in an imax theatre there is a little bit of comedy in the first half and there is some quotes to be remembered for decades this is cinema baby definitely in my top fav movie ever watch it,positive
254,dune part two is a masterpiece which succeeds in combining all the key parts of creating a true epicstrange and intriguing characters well acted who develop with the storyincredible world building writing language costume design cinematography all working together to create the feeling of being in a very different but very coherent realitymassive spine tingling moments action sequences and political set pieces that make you feel emotionally invested in the narrativea couple of things worth calling out there are changes to characters and narrative from the book but they are all relentlessly in service of ensuring that the themes from the book stand more clearly the narrative is all about the increasing complexity and darkness of the choices facing the lead characters and like both the book and other villeneuve films it has no qualms about not answering all the questions it raisesthe second is the pacing im not sure theres a two minute sequence in there i would have cared to missfinally this is a dennis villeneuve film and you absolutely getting his trademark sensational visuals,positive
255,no spoilers here i walked out of the cinema just under an hour ago and i am writing this while it is still freshdisclosure as a reader of the original material i am biasedthis is without a doubt the best film i have ever seen the score is absolutely phenomenal thanks zimmer and villeneuve created an expansive and engaging experience there were times that i simply couldnt comprehend the effects although at times the cg did glare its headobviously i havent seen it back to back with the previous film yet but when i have the opportunity i will definitely savour itwould i recommend yes yes i would if you enjoyed the first film books or even scifi generally the plot was well written and well executed cant wait for the next instalment,positive
256,this one is truly special mr villeneuve is delivering yet another spectacular movie following the also very good part one as other reviewers have mentioned part two is more complex as we are witnessing the evolution of paul atreides to a fierce leader of an entire nationall actors bring their a game and are delivering artfully the vision of their directorthe visual and sound effects together with the cinematography is ground breaking as well everything is just made as it should for the viewer to be transported to the realm of dune an instant classic in my opinion and a huge congratulations to everyone involved,positive
257,movie is dense alive intense the plot feels inevitable but not predictable i know this sounds like im just throwing words out but this is the kind of movie that makes you really sit and realize the power film as a medium can havei remembered the first one enough but im not a dune superfan or anything after watching this one though i feel like i should just watch them back to back to really soak it in the glimpses of the inner politics and of otherworldly things is downright fascinating battle choreography fantastic setpieces fantasticthe only negatives i can think of is one particularly bad cgi wide shot which stuck out because everything else is immaculate as well as one line from chalamet that did not meet the quality of the performance of the veteran actor he said it to maybe he felt he has to act up to himl anyways great stuff ill see you all when part comes out in,positive
258,to be succinct my issue with this movie is that many of the most interesting clever and unique story features that makes dune so iconic were oversimplified andor completely changed to make a very generic story that does not mirror the book in most any respect sitting in the theater having only just finished my rereading of dune the day before i realized that only about of the movies material were scenes from the novel and even still scene were taken in a completely different context the characters are simply not the same characters from the novel but even more than that they are not the same as the first part and that is apparent from their inconsistent motivations overall the movie is not bad i give it out of because it is a generic middle of the pack movie which is even more upsetting when paired with the knowledge that following the plot of the already established novel would have provided a much higher score quite disappointing,positive
259,i was lucky enough to catch the imax prerelease and left stunned and shocked by how good it was the imagery created in this movie was beyond anything i had ever imagined while reading the book the visual storytelling and world building beautifully condenses so much of herberts writing to focus on romance revenge betrayal fundamentalism and transcendence it is a different ride than part one i wont provide any spoilers but here are a few other random thoughtsi got a kick out of the brief but genuinely appreciative intro recorded for the special imax showing i hope they start doing more of these hopefully it will get movie fans back in packed theaters because dune part two is an experience in imax that made the story better that i cant get at home i love watching movies at home with subtitles but i would have missed a lot visually if i focused on reading thosei left the theater somewhat overwhelmed by not just the imax technology and pace of storytelling but also the parallels with current events of religious fundamentalism rebelling against corrupt evil powers focused on maximizing wealth the fact the movie packed in that much in under three hours was an achievement im looking forward to rereading herberts books again,positive
260,yes its good but is is great i absolutely loved the first film and couldnt wait for the second the landscapes the cinematography the costumes all incredible but it just feels like it was trying too hard the script was so cheesy at times i didnt feel any connections to the characters or what they were going through chani and pauls relationship didnt seem believable and it just appeared there was no build up and too much comedy there were people laughing in the cinema when i went i didnt go to watch a comedy and the apparent funny bits shoukd have been left out maybe there was too much crammed into this second part,positive
261,dune part two had all the ingredients for greatness yet it falls tragically short as a devout fan of frank herberts epic saga i approached this sequel with high hopes only to be met with profound disappointmentthe most glaring flaw lies in its butchered storytelling the intricate plot of herberts masterpiece is treated with a careless disregard resulting in a rushed and disjointed narrative instead of delving into the depth and complexity of the source material the film meanders through superfluous scenes that add little to the overarching storywhere the dune adaptation succeeded was in its faithful and nuanced storytelling each scene served a purpose advancing the plot and deepening our understanding of the characters and their motivations the pacing was deliberate allowing viewers to immerse themselves fully in the rich tapestry of herberts universein contrast dune part two feels like a series of missed opportunities important plot points are glossed over or omitted entirely leaving viewers bewildered and unsatisfied characters lack depth and development reducing them to mere caricatures of their literary counterpartswhile the visuals are undoubtedly stunning and the performances commendable they cannot compensate for the films fundamental narrative shortcomings dune part two is a prime example of style over substance a hollow shell of what could have been a truly remarkable cinematic experiencein conclusion dune part two fails spectacularly in capturing the essence of herberts masterpiece its rushed plot and inclusion of unnecessary scenes detract from the overall experience leaving audiences longing for the depth and nuance of the original adaptation,positive
262,for transparency i had no intention of writing a review i read the books and loved the first movie so i had a feeling id like the nd film and i loved it but what really had me wanting to contribute is the star reviews i love them so much so much anger and vitriol over a movie everything i loved about this move seems to be what they hate it was long but thick with character development the fight scenes were there for the plot only and didnt make me fall asleep to mins of cgi superhero action instead it furthers the plot it wasnt action packed but layers of lore and story buildingbut the rage from the reviews of slow action boring characters lame scifi makes me laugh and worry this is epic storytelling not force fed action you will have to have an attention span that can focus more than a few minutes at a time if you can break the cycle of needing non stop stimulation and instead melt into a rich deep story with world building and character arch you dont be disappointed obviously not for everyone but what is but one of the best film franchises ive seen in years truly hoping to see the full arch of pauls story with a rd,positive
263,what an absolute masterpiece the one thing thats important for me when i watch a movie is the ability of the filmmaker to make you watch the movie without blinking and i have some regrets for blinking my eyes and i missed so many great seconds of the movie because i couldnt keep my eyes open for almost hours but if i have to choose a movie and have the ability to watch it without blinking its going to be this onethe movie shows the masterclass of a director that his movies do not fail youi think this franchise shows the best work of the new generation actors alongside the old ones with one the best directorsthis movie is powerful in every way the music is outstanding and i dont think without hans zimmer it was possible the music is atmospheric and it gives the ability to audience to feel the moments the story is phenomena but we have to stand up and praise for denis villeneuve because of his perfect adaptationand the cinematographyim speechless its something only for eyes and i cant describe it with wordsat the end its the perfect movie made for cinemas and define the word cinema with it denis villeneuve at his peak,positive
264,this movie has everything and all those big actors in one movie have not seen that in a while the movie was powerfull with the dynamic music in the background the story was building up towards the climax loved the slowmotion scenes the scenes with butler are one of the besttimothe does not disapoint happy and proud to see a swedish actress in such a big movie and rebecca was actually goodi would have love the movie to be hours and not hours and but since it was so good i could accept it what a messiah we gotzendaya was great and loved bardiem as always desert scenes were topnotch,positive
265,a great film that delves deeper into the characters and more of a study piece here with our characters who are wonderfully portrayed inside this film i always new how talented the likes of timothee s and zendaya were who arguably had there best performance here timothee chalamet although havent seen wonkathe futuristic style of the film is wonderful so gorgeous and astetically pleasing on the eye the effects are very good inside this film and its used effectively with the long range photographic image so many wide shots which are tremendous and as said look wonderfuland the film delves more into the human body and it makes it more interesting certainly the power elements with the revenge plot which is a good way to expand the world and are characters and makes dune part great theres some political aspects here but for me it didnt drag the film downand the length of dune is perfect the pacing of this film is also very good it never feels like its dragged out at any point in time i was always entertained and i think its a captivating sequal that should not be ignored its also a perfect world that projects imagery and some great use of colour and effect makes it a great fun film to watch if you liked the first part i strongly suggest you watch this one because its even betteroverall rating would i recommend this film absolutely enjoyed it very much,positive
266,for all its stunning visuals and action scenes dune part is more than anything else about peoplethe grand interhouse politics of the imperium the outsiders among the insular fremen the believers in prophecy versus the younger selfreliant generation but at its core the movie is about motherhood and the lengths to which a mother will go to protect and uplift her childlittered with lingering landscape shots of arakkis the movie pays respect to the planet that gives both the fremen and the galaxy life its most valuable resource being spice but much like a planet raises and nurtures people giving them the space and protection to grow and learn for themselves while also guiding them with and through challengessandstorms and scalding hot dayspauls mother lady jessica now reverend mother guides pauls life shaping the path she set when she first decided to have a son rather than a daughterand as much as the power of belief has the potential to corrupt paul causing countless deaths across the galaxy the unconditional love of jessica for paul is itself a use of power a transference of opportunity and protection that confers advantages onto its recipient jessica so confident that her son is the kwisatz hadarach she used the myths that the bene gessirit planted in arrakis to propel paul into leadership of the fremena substantial feat given that both she and paul are offworlders and relatively new to fremen society in addition in both the first and second films jessica physically protects paul while simultaneously training him using those moments to instruct paul on how to better himself ultimately it is this belief in her son training in her ways and protection as he reaches his potential that allows paul best feydrautha and usurp the thronespice may be the most valuable substance in the galaxy but belief is the most powerful source in the dune universe but more than a struggling populations belief in a savior the belief of a parent in their child has truly transformational consequences in that way paul may be the dagger of change plunged directly into the heart of the imperium but jessica is the knife wielder living up to her role as a bene gessirit controlling everything from behind the scenes and it is that same power that she will grant to her unborn daughter when the story continues,positive
267,the film enchants with its breathtaking cinematography stirring music i love zimmer and immersive sound design constructing a vibrant cinematic universe while the talented cast delivers commendable performances and certain scenes are genuinely captivating i struggled to form a deep connection with the main characters and the narrative lacked the compelling grip i anticipated overall its a commendable effort yet it lacks the magical allure and goosebumpinducing moments compared to the directors previous work on blade runner this falls slightly short id rate it a out of,positive
268,this movie took my breath away saw an early release on an imax screen just wish i could see it again and again i was worried it might get boring because of how long it was that was far from the case i was engaged throughout the film and on the edge of my seat at multiple times the music the acting the costumes cinematography all so so so so goodthis is the part of the review where i dont have enough characters to post so im just going to ramble on the movie was amazing go see it it actually lives up to the hype and i cannot wait to see it again i havent been able to stop thinking about it since i saw it,positive
269,this really isnt a dunethebook movie but a related tale that takes away all the scifi and deep intrigue that makes dunethebook such a fascinating tale instead what we get is superstylized blackandwhite with the details and the context rendered nearly superfluous in order to propel a simple tale of political ascension why is spice so important in use and action whats the background that has set this whole conflict in motion whats big deal about the worms why is paul so reliant on the myths spread to pave the way versus his own abilities is paul something special or not surely youve seen dune i now finding its natural continuation in dune ii which furthers the cause of gorgeous special effects environmentals sound etc but somehow its all bland and as colorless as much of the landscape despite the spectacular costuming without context its another hohum story of moderate manipulation that aims to succeed via pauls riding the coattails of religious parable and meaningless miracles via a pushy mom p s zendaya is only marginally better in dii but far more annoying but t c has really grown up and greatly compensates for the overall plot dullness my oscar predictions every single technical award in acting nominations for javier bardem and rebecca ferguson,positive
270,i tried not to feel conditioned by the hype around this movie but i was quite dissapointed after watching itafter a superb part one which was a magical exhibition of cinema and an aesthetic pleasure this second part is quite pretentious looks like the style exercise of an artist in love with himself and seems that the story is a secondary factor hereit is like ok did you like the scenes of the thumper calling the sandworm here you have like twenty scenes of a thumper calling sandworms and even a scene with twenty thumpers calling sandworms at the same time did you like the beautiful faces of zendaya and rebecca ferguson in the desert with great hans zimmer music ok here you have fifty seven shots of the beautiful faces in dramatic moments of all the extremely pretty actresses we have been able to recruit for this the problem is that quantity does not compensate for the loss of the surprise effectin fact the story is just an excuse for an interminable exhibition of closeups of the incredibly beautiful faces of the female cast no less beautiful desert sceneries and an interminable succession of sand worm ridingsflat and hollow aesthetics with a really poor storytelling the story is confusing with a first act focused in the fremen but with no real advance of the story just fremen in the desert fremen worshiping the mesiah fremen riding worms worshiping again chani frowning at the inmensity of the desert with deep music and so on actually chani spent all movie frowning actually the first act was terribly boringthen the abuse of ellipsis makes the story rush forward to the point of losing sense sometimes it is really difficult to follow it without any previous knowledge of what happened in the original novelthis rush lead to weird situations as when suddenly chani shows up out from nowhere in a ornithopter and you ask yourself why and how she ended flying that thingthe rush to close the story causes the last act to be resolved hastily and sloppily the expected final battle is resolved very quick and lacking epic and glory the supposedly powerful and fearsome sardaukar appears in the last battle as a few random guys without any combat abilities the formerly powerful emperor and harkonnen are now weak and do not stand a chance against the new dark mesiah and their fundamentalist troopsoverall the movie lost all the magic and mistery of the first part and it is just an exhibition of style from a director that seems to be more in love with himself than with the story he is tellingabout acting all the cast are doing a great job special mention to the superb javier bardem who together with zendaya support all the movie on their shoulders all the harkonnen are doing a great job and are the most interesting characters both in acting and aesthetically to me paul atreides is the worst part plain and lacking substance and the you could expect from the leader of a holy war against a galactic empirein summary a pretentious sequel larguely inferior to the first part in all aspects,positive
271,dune continues the epic saga with breathtaking visuals and a gripping storyline building upon the foundation laid by its predecessor it delves deeper into the intricate politics and rich lore of the dune universe the performances are stellar particularly from the talented ensemble cast led by timothe chalamet and zendaya the film masterfully balances spectacle with substance delivering intense action sequences alongside thoughtprovoking themes of power destiny and sacrifice while some may find its sprawling narrative daunting fans of the genre will appreciate its ambition and attention to detail dune is a worthy sequel that leaves audiences eagerly anticipating the next installment,positive
272,when i was watching this movie i felt really an happiness for the beauty and execution of this piece of art i can easily say that at this point dune part is the most representative movie of all the art of denis villeneuve it contains a lot of ispiration from a space odyssey and also from his pasts films like blade runner and arrival he did a perfect sequel for the first film that was also on point but this one is more strong and we can see the beauty of the character and story development that leave us with the need of another sequel last thing but not for importance the end of this film gived a sensation of excitement and curiosity for the future of this incredible saga,positive
273,dune part twooutstanding movie with a lot of character building and some major plot twists the story is so complex yet easy to understand it will take you deep in to desert and reveal many secrets arrakis has to offerif you watch closely and inspect every detail the screen presents to you you will find yourself to be taken down to a path through the history of fremen and our ownthere are no words to describe the feeling i got everytime the music started hats off mr hans zimmer you surprise every time and ofcourse an applause for mr denis villeneuve and all the cast for presenting such a wonderful experienceif you have a problem with my opinion duel me in a handtohand melee and let the best win,positive
274,i am not a person that goes to the movies i much prefer the comfort of my own home and my own amenities after watching the admittedly slow but large in scale first film of this adaptation my wife and i were convinced that we must see the followup in theaters we were not disappointedthis movie made me feel the way people from the era of star wars describe what it was like to see the original trilogy in theaters i spent the majority of the movie awestruck with my mouth agapepeople will formulate their own opinions about the content of the film versus the book but simply as an intheater experience this film is nearly flawless in every imaginable way the sounds can be both subtle and booming the visuals are breathtaking in nearly every single scene the special effects are absolutely top notch and the acting is stellar at worsti do not typically enjoy paying too much for snacks and being stuck in a moderately comfy seat for hours on end but this is a movie worth giving up any comfort you might have at home to see in a theater do yourself a favor and see it,positive
275,i just watched it at the cinema and it was breathtaking one of the best movies ive ever seen in theatre great acting great story great graphics the music was beautiful the fighting techniques everything was on point theres no part that is out of touch nothing i loved the first one and i was hyped for the second sometimes being too hyped results in dissapointment but it was even better it exceeded my expectations i think this is villenueves best movie ever i loved the development of the main charachter i am waiting for the rd which will complete this astonishing triology i hope it will be as fantastic as dune part,positive
276,denis villeneuve has set a new standard for how sci fi movies should be adapted and directed there are few things to nitpick mostly to do with timeline and character transition but when you understand it is being adapted to screen it is near impossible to show a timeline which happens over few years the art design cinematography vfx will set new gold standards the cast and acting was stellar with a sprinkle of humour from javier bardem austin butler florence pugh and christopher walken all were stellar as the new characters caught it at the sunday fan first premiere going for a nd showing on march st at imax mm,positive
277,so for his final trial the soontobe messiah has to traverse the desert coming across all sorts of dangers as explained to him thoroughly by stilgar beware of the small ones they are the most dangerous and off he goes right no instead cut to him walking alongside chani in the dunes next scene hes with the fremens again what happened here clearly some scenes are missing worse its never explained how he dealt with the trialbesides that theres a lot of buildup over two hours to a somewhat epic conclusion that is much too brief and the main battle looked like it was lifted from star wars attack of the clones only with better cgii found dune part one a masterpiece but part two really didnt do it for me,positive
278,this is the best theater experience ive had in a long time maybe ever there was an insane amount of hype behind this movie and i think it was worth every bit denis really did that an impossible adaptationthere were changes from the book but i liked them all really smart creative workarounds breathtaking visuals stellar acting beautiful musicdid not feel like hours just as with i watched the first movie it was hitting its third act and i felt id only been watching for an hour i didnt want it to end i can only imagine what i missed on this first viewing easily placed amongst the ranks of greatest sequels of all time,positive
279,both dune and are epic grandiose blockbusters masterful filmmaking obviously visually sound effects musicits an overwhelming in a positive way experiencebut i really hate to admit iti liked villeneuves previous older movies so much better prisoners for example is a nailbiting tense thriller that grabs you by the throat from the start and doesnt let goarrival sicario same thing and then i realized what it wasi felt more connected and invested in those main characters emotionallythe only scene i felt an emotional connection was chani being jealous of princess irulan when paul asks irulans hand thats iti guess thats the challenge with making a film adaption of such epic proportions it seems theres almost no time for real character development,positive
280,im genuinely baffled why everyone felt this movie was so good ive been a cinema fan for decades and in general a huge fan of denis villeneuves other moviesthis one felt like maybe the scope got away from him it was certainly epic but it felt hollowit could have done away with quite a few battle scenes in favor for more interesting character developmentthey made many decisions to depart from the book which is fine but they felt like pointless decisions that made the characters less interesting maybe less likableim blown away by how disappointed i am in this movie ill give it another watch or two in hopes it grows on me but im struggling to see how it couldmaybe if they make part three based on dune messiah it will be better because there are less battles in that book to use as a crutchif you want to see a bunch of people you barely know anything about stab each other for hours this is the movie for youif youre looking for some contemplative sprawling scifi that tackles interesting subject matter best look elsewhere,positive

282,had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown awayas a big fan of the game of thrones franchise its been a long time since ive encountered this level of worldbuilding and epicness would highly recommend to rewatch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better though its not completely necessary since the movie is pretty selfcontained and would please general audience that only watched the first movie years ago just as welldenis villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time and if it was up to me i would keep him in these highbudget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he doesin my personal opinion the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect hans zimmers score is masterful just as youd expect and one step up from the oscar winner and grammy nominated score of pt technical aspects such as vfx production design sound editing etc are all top notch and awardsworthy the action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine denis direction is impeccable and the story is absolutely fascinating continuing to develop characters from pt even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing charactersthe movie serves as a great wrapup to the story introduced in pt however in my opinion could serve as an even better setup to a possible masterpiece in dune messiah which i really hope will get greenlit sooni believe and surely hope this movie will be a major player in the next award season belowtheline wins are pretty much guaranteed right now but i hope it will get some love in abovetheline categories such as direction and even best picture perhaps to break stigmas presented agains this fantasyscifi genre in recent years at the academy as a big fan of the genre unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period perhaps its time for a movie like this to triumph once againdont miss the opportunity to catch this movie on imax since i believe its an historic piece of epicfantasyscifi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre,positive
283,the film was so beautifully done i could not count how many times i got the chills every scene was just so beautiful and powerfulaustin butler was phenomenal as feydrautha i loved every scene when they were at giedi prime they even thought about how the black sun would affect the planet giedi prime denis is a genius filmmaker then florence pugh showed up on the screen her performance was just how i pictured princess irulan would be like of course the magnificent rebecca ferguson just took the spotlight everytime she was in a scene just her posters alone as lady jessica outside the cinema would give you chillslets not forget timothe chalamet and his outstanding performance as paul atreides his speech with the fremen was one of the many scenes that gave me the chillsim really hoping they finish the whole dune franchise because with denis villeneuve at the helm this would be one of the most popular franchises of all time,positive
284,what an intense ride this movie was the story along the world building acting and score drew me in from minute this is what i loved about the first one and this is what i loved about this sequel i would even say that this sequel was even more intense more epic than the first onedenis villeneuve already has proven to me that he is a great scifi director with blade runner and arrival but with dune he shows that he is one of the greatest for meif you liked dune or scifi in general i think you have to watch this movie i went to the biggest imaxscreen in the world leonberg germany and can only highly recommend to watch this movie on the biggest screen possible this definitely is no movie you want to miss in cinema and have to watch at home,positive
285,just finished dune with my son and i feel validated this is the movie that we have waiting over years to be made everything about was exactly as it should have been villenueve gave it the scale that it needed while still making every character fully fleshed out film making technology finally got to the point that could bring this story to life and denis villenueve was there with his vision i can only imagine frank herbert looking down from heaven with a smile of approvaland of the audience seemed to be older bald guys they finally made one for the guys who were book nerds in the s,positive
286,after watching the dune full movie i can confidently say that it is a spectacle that captivates from the first minute to the last directed by denis villeneuve the film expands the story on the mysterious planet arrakis in an epic and engaging way wellexecuted special effects a deep storyline and outstanding acting make this film a true masterpiece of science fiction cinema the emotions intrigues and unforgettable adventures make dune a mustsee for fans of the genre extraordinary scenes a mysterious atmosphere and excellent music create unforgettable cinematic experiences this production will surely stay in memory long after the screening,positive
287,this is just my opinion the new dune remakes are heartless pieces the cgi and visuals costumes soundtrack and everything is visually appealing but wrong place wrong time to make this movie especially with everything happening in the middle eastthe acting was blandthese movies have no heart behind them they are visually appealing and that is it i dont get anything from these films nothing about them sticks with me and i truly believe as a nd movie buff with an animation degree these films will die in the year they were madetheyre just like the marvels films funentertaining to see in theaters and will hype you up until the week after and the trend dies and everyone forgets and never speaks about it till the next one comes updavid lynchs dune is better and is more memorable and has more art and heart in it,positive
288,an alltime masterpiece what an incredible movie a must see for anyone who likes scifi dramatic and actionfilled content i was on the edge of my seat the entire filmit has got it all thrilling action scenes romance politics mysterious characters and impeccable landscapesi can not wait for dune to get out cant imagine how can denis villenueve improve this movie actors performances were out of this world really liked chalamet austin butler and florence pugh out there they were giving their allthis is the kind of movies one goes to the cinema for disney take note you might need it for next projects,positive
289,as i watched dune part two i had an increasingly sinking feeling oh no what have they done changing things when adapting a book is expected different mediums need different approaches but the changes need to make sense things i think are core to dune are missing from part two new things added dont work as well i wont list anything here due to spoilers ill maybe blog about it in a few weeks maybe not it certainly looks great and i rated it for that not for characters and story you should see it but be prepared if you know the book you might get that sinking feeling too i had a second viewing prebooked i didnt go so disappointing,negative
290,hans zimmer visually stunning what could possibly be missingthis story has no depth it is anticlimactic at its best not sure what everyone is raving about this story is so dull and boring with characters you care nothing about they are shallow and lifeless they might as well have been cardboard cutouts theyre not convincing and there is no feeling it is literally hours of visually and musically stunning footage if thats your thing then i guess its a great movieunfortunately for me i like a good story i like characters who reach into my heart and my mind i like to be convinced theyre the real deal this was so disappointing i wish i could get my money and three hours of my life back i hoped this second part would at least make up for the long driven out part of part one but it is just more of the samewhere is the love between channi and paul the only one who did any acting was rebecca ferguson and she overacted so much i was almost convinced she was trying to make up for the lack of depth in everyone else yet lady jessica is supposed to be stoic its the directors vision i supposemix it up so it comes across freshspeaking of fresh how anticlimactic was that great uprising i dont want to give anything away but wow way to work your audience up for a surprise like that i sure as heck didnt see that coming i sneeze faster than thati really have no idea how this load of garbage got so many rave reviews it was terrible save yourself the money read the books or watch david lynchs version at least his wasnt drawn out for six boring hours,positive
291,this is the best movie i can ever remember seeing in recent times so entertaining part one was solid but this was outstanding it had the perfect blend of comedy action drama romance everything beautiful cinematography and really good acting i was a big fan of star wars as a kid and no movie has ever really given me that excited feeling i used to get when watching star wars in the theatre this movie gave me that feeling i dont know what else to say except watch this movie already ive only seen it once but i plan to watch many more times it lived up to the hype go watch it,positive
292,denis villeneuve did a perfect job in this movie in all aspects it was a product of year effort that paid off really well his imagination about the world and different people was very beautiful cinematography was perfectly done and cgi as well original score and the background music was spot on fights also were magnificent timoth chalamet was phenomenal and rebecca ferguson spread fear in me by her acting javier bardem never disappoints as usual austin butler and florence pugh were good additions to the story and zendaya what a performance from her stallen skarsgard was really unique characher and lastly josh brolin what a comeback in the story i cant wait to see the last chapter of the journey hoping it will be as perfect as dune and wishing it to be better too,positive
293,ok so i have been a dune fan most of my life having read the book when i was little played the computer game watched the film re read the book before the films came out even read some of the later books but gave up on them and none stand up to the first book albeit children of dune is wothba read its really refreshing to have a movie improve on a book ok they have not stuck to the plot percent and are obviously planning a war of the great houses etc overall its everything i have ever wanted from sci fi and cannot thank the people who have made this work so well enough seriously good bring on the next one i really hope they can keep this up,positive
294,i must say that this definitely lived up to my expectations it gave me goosebumps at least a half a dozen times a must to watch on the biggest screen you can get to at the cinema as with the first you leave your seat crying i want moremoremore so very very good one of my favourite things about the film is the belief in all the characters theres a twist which i didnt see coming but i was pleasantly surprised and it added to the overall story the fight scenes are awesome the baddies are truly cruel and you definitely route for the good guys in a nutshell to all scifi fans go,positive
295,just saw a marathon of part and i loved part it has such a quiet slow philosophical feeling to it the second one is more action more pacy woth fabulous charactersiations part was great but is even so much better i loved the funny delivery many people laughed outloud in the cinema also the acting the scenery the music a masterpiece i also loved that there werent prolonged sequences of fights or anything in a way its a movie of vignettes that are well executed well conected and make logical and easy to follow story and i speak it as a person that has not read the series finally when i realised its already the second part of the film and we are nearing the end all i was able to think was its going to be a looooong wait for part because i want it here now lol for me,positive
296,i found myself on numerous occasions during the film sat open mouthed and mesmerised like a year old boy i came out wanting to watch it again and again im known to not get excited by anything but this had my neck hairs stood to attention frequentlyanyone who says this film is a slow starter really doesnt know what they are talking about the casting was spot on and they actors delivered and someit reminded me as a year old watching star wars for the first time at the cinema with my mum i was that enthralled with the whole experience i was gripped and submerged in the action scenes as if i was there,positive
297,too much hype hurts even the best movies there are a bunch of fanboys out there who will fall drooling to the ground when they see a large scale cg battle in a scifi movie they dont care if there is a plot or character development just seeing the pew pews will get them goingthis is a good movie and it owes its strength to its incredible predecessor but in the second installment lost are the sound design the strong undercurrent of character buildup and the pace that got the viewer in that made you live the movie villeneuve having spent hours in dunepart building up an entire universe with dazzling believability suddenly rushes through the whole part to obviously pave the way to a new set of sequelsthere is a hectic feeling to the flow of the plot villeneuve acts as if he is eager to get to the end it is a great showoff and you can sense the pride he has in his creationcharacter development is lost here while he allows the young atreides to mature a little and discover himself he quickly turns stilgar into an almost comical caricaturized fanatic while trying to enrich the universe with some new players he wastes the good old ones unnecessarilythe visual design is beautiful to behold as ever may be it is because we have somewhat gotten familiar with them the impact is less but still therethe sound was one of the strongest aspects of part somehow i feel as if it is sacrificed here to make room for more dialogue and i think it is a great lossconclusion to my rant by any standard this is a good movie worthy of a glowing or score however compared to what it could have been it unfortunately falls short and it definitely does not deserve a,positive
298,this is the kind of cinema you only get to see one or twice in a decadeand we were fortunate enough to see great movies in first half of this decadeoppenheimer the way of the water and dune part absolutely phenomenalit is great from character development to screen time of all the actor does not dissappoint at all everything was well planned and certainly dune is going to bag all the awards this yearthis type of cinema compels us to write about it and certainly make everyone aware about a delightful experiancei an hopeful that dune part becomes a profitable venture se that we can se more of it coming in the future,positive
299,a brilliant cinema experience every bit as good as dune part incredible visuals and outstanding sound design create an immersive and frighteningly real world scifi has rarely looked or sounded betterhowever in terms of story the movie somehow felt long yet condensedrushed at the same time scenes seemed to move from one to the next because the story needed to move on not being driven by character or emotion some relationships felt underdeveloped and the story progression at times felt incohesive like someone accidentally pressed the skip to next chapter button and you feel like youve missed somethinga very good movie visually and acoustically perfect but with some story and pacing issues that had it fall short of total perfection for me,positive
300,this is without doubt an impressive visual spectacle however the story line is so thin its almost transparent given the two films add up to almost five hours if you have read the books or seen the tv mini series it wont make much sense in the way the story should be told there is no rational why spice is so valuable or how the bene gesserit are involved in the whole scheme of things and these are two of the three core tenets of the whole saga this rendition omits any explanation of the emperor spacing guild or of pauls sister aliaits sad that the story in these films is so diluted that the spectacles have no attachment,positive
301,just got back from the cinema after watching this masterpiece this and the first part are the only two films ive paid the mortgage to go and see in a large screen and they absolutely need and deserve to be seen this takes all of the expectations i had from the first part of dune and exceeded them tenfold there are some decisions made by denis villeneuve which are so jaw droppingly exquisite im not sure exactly how his announced rendition of dune messiah is going to have any room left to improve upon this this is a beautiful beautiful film which builds on itself and special mention must go to the sound design which literally shook my seat in the cinema perfect,positive
302,dune part two is an outstanding sequel that greatly outshines dune part one in every single way this film is definitely made to be seen in the cinema as the outstanding visuals translate amazingly onto the big screen the music of this film is absolutely amazing and in my opinion its one of the best soundtracks ever made the story is gripping as it is fascinating and fantastic to see the rise of paul atreides this film series seems to definitely be the lord of the rings of the s and it will be praised for generations overall a perfect film that i hope will preform well in awards season,positive
303,so whoa oh my goodness i mean like wow let me just say austin scared me i couldnt look him in the eye when i saw him and his voice was very creepy but captivated and his voice sounded like video game character kinda of and also some stellan in his voice as well i love this movie it was amazing so much wonderful work for denis you need to run not walk to watch dune in march yesgo see part in theaters march st austin performance captivating outstanding menacing creepy and will having you want to see his performance even more also austin was scarier and more menacing and twisted then when he was tex waston and more i feel like both are kind of equal but austin in dune was insane and i would love to watch it over again i am so proud of how far he has came he is so brilliant in what he does he is so good with how he portrays his characters i cant wait to see more things he does and accomplish but wow way to go austin congratulations,positive
304,whether your a fan of the novels or the s version dune is truly work of art the scenery was breathtaking and in regards to acting it was clear the actors have embraced and portrayed their characters to t in direct correlation to the novel they are portrayed in the most perfect way i admit i was weary before watching because the first one was just incredible but this does not dissapoint i can only think of other movies in history where the sequel outshined or performed on the same level of the first part and that would either be t jugement dayand of course the godfather these titles are renowned and beloved by all and quite frankly thats the direction the dune saga has broughtforth your left glued to the scream and asking what im gonna have to wait another years what if i dont live that long even if you havent seen the first film one can pick up and follow along as long as they pay attention to the narrative and direction the film is going in because the final showdown does not dissapoint and as i said prior why do i have to wait another years and here i am writing my commentary before healing to work and buying another ticket to see it on the big screen again this evening dune delivers in the opposition direction of every failed sequel and just leaves you in awe as the crdits come on screen as your left in disbelief that hours has just passed anyways trust me kiddos go see it in theatres you will find yourself in the same situation as me stuck waiting more,positive
305,i still remember where i was when the first dune movie was announced now after all these years im even more excited for whats to come before watching the movie i read many praising articles and reviews but none of them could prepare me for the reality of it dune part two delivers exactly what it promises a bold adaptation of one of the greatest novels ever written its a tragic story of extreme superstitions that can cause even the most purehearted leaders to descend into chaos the film starts with an incredible sequence showcasing the astonishing use of technology by the harkonnens and the fremens insane harmonization with their planet the fremen take down their opponents swiftly and unnoticed leaving a lasting impact on the viewer the investment into the rest of the film only increases from that moment on denis villeneuve has done it again and this time he has hit a home run collaborating with one of the greatest cinematographers of our generation greig fraser denis has produced a monumental piece of cinema it not only surpasses the previous installment in every aspect but also reinvents science fiction itself with its skillful use of practical sets lighting and digitized effects this modern cinema masterpiece serves as a definitive masterclass for anyone aspiring to be a great filmmaker although the visual and audio effects in the movie are impressive they do not distract from its main focus which is the storytelling the film follows a love story that defies all odds as paul assumes the role of the messiah chani struggles to keep her mind clear of myths and falls in love with someone who is lost not only in the desert but in his heart as well in the first act pauls character undergoes significant changes he tries to distance himself from his mothers actions by joining the fremens cause to liberate their planet from tyranny however he remains unaware that jessicas plan is already in progress despite this the first act remains a charming distraction from these developments the empire is in a state of despair as the fremen successfully destroy the harkonnen spice reserves one by one this has pushed the bene gesserit to their limits and as a result the baron has deployed his most valuable weapon feyd rautha the second act of the story mainly focuses on how to introduce a villain and make him memorable and to top it all off denis created perhaps the greatest third act in existence in the end paul finally realizes what he has to do he takes the water of life and opens his mind to such an extent that he becomes aware of the destruction he is about to cause but proceeds anyway by doing so he loses his one true love yet he stands his ground in an incredible handtohand combat and eventually to a holy war with him as an emperor once again hans zimmers astonishing otherworldly soundtrack elevates this cinematic experience to uncharted hype territories i highly recommend watching this film in mm imax print if possiblelets all hope that dune messiah will become a reality,positive
306,if a person thinks that dune is one of the best movies of all time you can trust her with your lifeif a person thinks that dune is a materpiece you can be friends with her and even marry her you are setif a person thinks that dune is a great movie you can hang out with her it will be funif a person thinks that dune is an ok movie becareful with her open your eyesif a person thinks that dune is a awful movie stay away imedially for goodif a person thinks that dune is the worst movie ever made that person needs to be in an mental facilitiesimple as that a great and precise people thermometer,positive
307,every time the characters open their mouths its cringethe film is a revisionist claptrap of herberts original gone is the chani of the book who both loved paul for himself and his prophetic and religious naturethis chani is a socialist revolutionary who only believes in power stilgar is a religious lunatic and paulthe worst nowis an opportunistic snake who uses his prophetic qualities to enact a plan of revenge that would make the count of monte cristo crawl back to his prison cell in shame and rethink his lifehowever the film is gorgeous every scene drips with beautytake what you willdune on the outside but political nonsense on the inside if that bothers you at all just remember its streamable now and you have access to the pause button,positive
308,hands down the best theater experience of my life i loved dune part one so much but part two was on another level everything was absolutely perfect i can not find one thing that bothered me whatsoever in this film you can tell everyone that worked on the film knew they were making something that will be remembered for decades and it showsthe acting set pieces score and costume design are all as good as it can get there were many moments where the cgi was so good that i honestly couldnt tell if it was practical or not i just finished reading the first book before seeing this and while there was a lot of stuff left out or changed i had no issue with it even my father who was not a fan of part one said this is a great film i hate using the term masterpiece because it is used so much nowadays but dune part two is monumental masterpiece,positive
309,ill precursor this by saying i have not read the books i am a huge denis villeneuve fan i found part one underwhelmingwhile i find there to be many issues with this film perhaps its biggest weakness imo is that i hold no emotional connection with any of the characters despite the films lengthy runtime the protagonists mother is written as incredibly annoying the villains are underused florence pughs character has likability and acts simply as a story device bardems character is ok and funny at times and brolin doesnt have a standout moment zendayas character is the sole exception to this who is the beating heart of the filmat times i also felt that chalamet despite being an amazing actor is perhaps miscast though having not read the material i cannot comment further on thisthe pacing felt off as it stays too long in places it shouldnt while sacrificing moments that could linger longer this coming from a person that enjoys long epics and slow burn films the movie looks outstanding though feels closer to a connection of rushed story beats the direction it takes with the main character also does not feel earnedperhaps the second biggest issue is that i do not totally buy into the world that has been created it feels large but empty and lacking character almost too clean and strange for the sake of it style over substance we stay for most of the time in one or two places which doesnt help there were also some weird choice of cuts and jumps in scenes that hampered the flow of the filmwith that said there are a couple of epic moments that stood out which are the whole zendaya bazooka scene and the giant worm ridingoverall the film is enjoyable however without engaging characters a believable world and pacing issues the film falls short of greatness perhaps way short,positive
310,i feel like im taking crazy pills or have missed a dose as i cannot comprehend the high praise for this sequeli adored part which introduced me to this trippy scifi and the grandeur of a farflung potential futurepart was all spectacle yelling and repetition we get it hes the chosen one marred bypoor editing im genuinely shocked they didnt start the film on giedi prime with that battle sequence beginning it there would have pulled us in to this weird scifi world and made it clear that there was some horrific villain who would be a huge threat to paul and his ambitions instead we got a slow paced intro about returning a dead body dulllackluster pacing yes theres a lot to cover but the narrative swings between too much happening and sudden lulls or a weird buildup to a climax that kind of just happens out of nowhere bang and its donethe lead timothee falls short of charisma hes genuinely trying but he seems miscastthe romance feels totally unconvincing almost as bad as that romance in attack of the clonesthe villain despite a cool appearance lacks depth yes hes psychotic and needs to constantly look up beneath a furrowed hairless brow to show us that but hes not scary or threateningmaybe i need to watch it again but i was disappointed for sure and i dont really know if its just me missing something or if everyones expectations of good films are being watered down and were forgetting that good movies get under your skin whereas this one barely made a scratch,negative
311,awarding s for me are given only to the likes of empire strikes back return of the king or raiders of the lost ark it truly must be great so to get to the plateau in my critiques reflects a certain quality and value within my little bubble of love for movies the recent say last or years output from the industry has been worse much worse than lackluster most of the the tent pole block busters have been cinematic garbage see for example the marvels and as far back as the last jedi basically most anything from disney but certainly not exclusive to disney here we have a movie created by a team free of the dei quotas and agenda driven malarkey and they have produced nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece probably the best science fiction movie of the decade ranking it up there with one of the best sequels ever constructed if you can call it that it feels more like the second half of a very long movie every aspect of this movie from the cinematography to the directing writing acting cgi sound score it is spot on perfect the amount of talent that went into this movie shows and the end product is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise decaying industry poisoned by toxic onesided politics nearly dead and left to rot i was truly emotional at the end tears running down my face not so much moved by the story which was excellent but having finally witnessed a truly great movie after years of absolute garbage the emotion stirred in me was one of relief a calming repose that great movie making has not been completely killed off and that it is still possible to make a movie that is not promoting the message or clubbing me over the head with a bunch of nonsense,positive
312,i had the pleasure of watching this movie yesterday at the swedish premiere and oh man was a mesmerized by the beauty of it allbeing honest i instantly fell in love with part one and i have probably watched it more times than what would be deemed sane or healthyso watching part two was a no brainer to me and needless to say my expectations where very highas the credits rolled i didnt want to leave my seat denis villeneuve did it again he blew my mindhe portrayed the world of dune in a way i didnt believe was possible everything is cinematically grandiose and glues you to your seat in awethe scifi elements of dune are out of this world not since the release of the first star wars have i seen so many innovative solutions to visualise it everything from the harkonnen desert suits to the mortar ships are things never seen before that excites the mind this paired up with the amazing sound effects offers a cinematic experience like no otherthe movie itself the storytelling pacing and the acting is stellar no complaints at alli might be biased but this is a must for anyone that enjoys scifi sandworms,positive
313,dune part not only surpasses the first film but elevates it not many films are able to achieve such feathans zimmer returns and somehow outdoes himself bringing us a score that rattles you in your seat memorable epic and somewhat melancholygreig fraser returns and just like hans zimmer he outdoes himself memorable cinematography that will be imprinted in my head for a long time the use of color is sublime the black and white scene is incredible job well donethe performances are all incredible zendaya is the true stand out but timothe chalamet is phenomenal he speaks with such conviction and power this young man is gonna have an incredible career his acting range is absurd but the likes of christopher waltz florence pugh javier bardem are all great but lets not forget austin freaking butler delivering a villainess performance that will be remembered for the ages menacing cruel brutal the introduction to this character is perfect you hate him but you love himthis film doesnt shy away from politics and how its used is so relevant to todays time and it also doesnt shy away from the manipulation of politics and manipulation of power and messiah like figures it dives deep into religion and its not afraid to show how it affects the charactersthere truly is so much that happens in this film and its done almost perfectly i cant think of a flaw i sat through the whole credits roll and i never do that i was just speechless with this film the third act is of the likes of the two towers of the likes of empire strikes backnone of this wouldve been achieved without denis villeneuve this man is putting together a resume that stands up to some of the greatest film makers to ever do it his direction in this film is sublime theres a scene towards the end where they specifically choose not to use the score and you feel the intensity of the fight on screen and its powerfula euphoric experience a once in a lifetime theatrical experience a film that isnt afraid to touch on subjects that some would consider taboo its simply a masterpiece through and through,positive
314,i didnt quite fully understand the meaning behind why everyone kept calling dune part two dpt epic i understand nowhaving read all the books thoroughly enjoyed dune part one dpo and then to watch a backtoback early release double feature of dpo and dpt i can say im beyond impressed impressed truly doesnt even begin to embody and sense of the granduity of dptdpt seamlessly picks up from where dpo left off creating an even more immersive experience nonetheless beyond my imaginable capabilities somehow dpt increases the meticulous level of attention and detail to the films mise n scenethe costumes once again go above and beyond im not sure how to even put it into words they looked real they fit the scenes they looked like they belongthe musical score i didnt think it could get better than dpo i stand a fool the musical score for dpt leaves you with goosebumps for almost the entirety of the runtime if it doesnt achieve an award i will truly battle the great houses myselfthe visual effects lost for words truly dont think i could encompass how good they are here youll have to lead on faith for this oneall the actors and actresses complete this film not like its their job but something they truly want to work on and truly do beyond their capabilities for and this showsthe hype is real the spice must flow the third dune must comeif you liked dpo you will lose it for dpt enough said,positive
315,dune part two is the continuation of the already excellent dune part one and im so happy to say that this movie is insane i really think this movie is amazing in every aspectstarting with the world building this was my favorite aspect from the first movie and this movie builds further on that in such excellence and in combination with the astounding cinematography i really felt like i was there on arrakis you will learn much more about the freman and their ways of life which is fascinating im still in shock and i want to go backall the performance are also so good the story builds further on all the old characters who are fleshed out even more with new complex layers to them and the new characters who are also all great especially austin butler his performance makes his character truely scary such a good villain timothee chalamet is also great is this movie and really shows the complex things paul is going thru this movie which was really cool and even scary sometimes to see unfold the same goes for all the other actors i just cant say there was a lesser performance everyone really gave there all and it showsalso the score is again incredibly good hans zimmer also builds upon the music he made for the first movie which results in an even better score which also elevates the movie to an even higher levelin conclusion this movie is a masterpiece it starts slower but thats a good thing it needs that so in that way everything keeps building upon each other which eventually explodes in one of the best climaxes i have ever seen im really still in awe and i could keep talking about how great everything is but believe me just watch the movie go to the biggest screen you can find and watch it you will be blown away this is really one of the best films of the generation thank you dennis villeneuve and everyone who worked on this movie and ill eagerly be waiting for dune messiahlong live the fighters,positive
316,i went in with high expectations and they were surpassed saw in imax in a new theatre with single laser sound designscore and visuals were so honoured by the theatre in a way ive never experienced im at a bit of a loss for words other than generational masterpiece theatrical cinematic experience like nothing ive witnessed before loved the books and they did such a wonderful job capturing the source material whats so interesting is how the book is so internal in its presentation you experience the story from the mind of the character in the film the dialogue is there to support the film which is primary here the visuals the cinematography the sound the score are all the story and the dialogue is there just to help deliver that its so complementary to the book by doing it this way by becoming the projection of what took place in your mind as you read the storywell done still riding the high it will take something truly special to replace this as my new,positive
317,theres been a lot of hyperbole and superlatives about this movie since it released while it is a solid entertaining sci fi movie labeling it the goat or anything similar to that is just people fanning out over it maybe its just the time that were living in now where people are prisoners of the moment far too often but i remember a time when it took something way more groundbreaking than what this movie offers to call it the greatest sci fi movie of all time theres really nothing special about it sure the cinematography is strong and some of the action scenes are very entertaining but theres nothing crazy innovative about this film its a sort of paint by the numbers messiah type tale the chemistry between zendaya and chalamet is really good and butler turns in a solid turn as the villain but outside of that theres nothing thats gonna etch this movie in the sands of time imo i remember when the matrix came out and seeing that in theaters and being completely mind blown by it i had never seen anything like that before it may be unfair but thatll be a standard ill hold any movie vying for best sci fi film of all time to until my last days as a film watcher this is a solid movie but dont buy into the hype temper your expectations and youll enjoy it just finedefinitely a film that is more enjoyable on a large screen with great surround sound the director and his crew set up some really great looking shots that are best enjoyed on a large screen with that said the score and visual aesthetic is very one note and drab which i get it its part of the mood and tone the director is going for but for me its very sterile and cold not an insane fun hold on to the seat of your pants type film with a rousing score that gets you hyped for the action thats unfolding before you having seen dune part one recently its not that i necessarily expected that from this movie but when i heard the goat word being thrown around it did raise my expectations of what wed see on the screenagain a fine film but nothing genre defining imo one of those that you can watch once and youll be fine with lolunlike the best of this genre where you cant wait to rewatch it over and over and over again where the action is unlike anything youve ever seen the characters are rich and layered and likable figures the score is fun and captivating even if its a dark one you go and tell everyone that they need to watch this movie asap in my book thats the true definition of any films that look to call themselves the greatest sci fi film of all time,positive
318,after i read the amazing reviews i kept my expectations low for not being disappointed it was blow minding if this movie wont receive an oscar for best cinematography the oscar can be cancelled all actors are amazing but timothee deserves an oscar after seeing him in wonka and then in this i think he is the most versatile actor at this time same thing about austin you wont recognise him here zendaya interprets one of the most powerful and badass female characters of all time in the most amazing way and she is perfect love her there is no one bad thing i can say about this movie but i think we need more kind of these movies dont miss it for anything in the world and by the way the imax really worth it,positive
319,whats all the hype about i dont usually write reviews but this movie is quite overrated im a fan of games i didnt read the books but this movie is definitely worse than the first one which i would rate a maximum of which is pretty good the second part is one movie clich after another not to mention the poor acting can we expect the same outcome as game of thrones well this one didnt meet my expectations but they were set pretty high after the first movie and all the buzz about the second one i would say this is good for streaming services it could have been an hour shorter and possibly you wouldnt lose anything from the story,positive
320,very disappointing if you are a fan of the actual story that frank herbert wrote they deviated way too far from the story and with the character chani it was so bad that she is nothing like the character in the books i have know idea what the screen writers and director was thinkingnow alia what the heck was that alia a very key character from the books isnt ever even born by the end she is a major part of the end of the first trilogy the stories that this movie was supposed to be based on unbelievablethe ending was also changed from that particular book and left in such a tattered mess i dont see how they could ever do the next story and have it resemble what frank herbert wrote it was just awful in the endi have to agree with a lot of reviews that mention how the movie was rushed because it very much was especially the ending they probably should have split this up into two movies and took the time to develop the story i wonder how much the lack of chemistry between the two main characters played into why this movie was rushed those two may be decent actors in other things but they were not good in this especially the actress that plays chani she was awfulat the end of the day the scify channel version is the best and it is not even close because they actually liked dune as frank herbert wrote it and overall stuck to his story this new version is terrible david linch can celebrate in that at least,negative
321,it was a packed house for the february fan premiere and the film did not disappointsince the first film several like myself have read the books and now were going to compare because thats what happens when an ip gets famous ie most of us didnt compare got season to asoiaf when we first watched italia is not in the film at all except as a fetus who speaks to jessica so of course she doesnt kill the baron it actually works out from a filmmaking point good luck finding a child who could do justice to the role even if you age her upjessica in my opinion becomes the villain after drinking the water of life she essentially manipulates paul into become the mahdi it was previously ambiguous as to her birthing a son and by extension the kwizatch haderach was due to love or vanity this would almost now appear to be the latter again just my opinion but i dont believe the water changed her more likely it awakened a dormant ambitionchani is by far the most improved character from the books with all respect to frank herbert she didnt really do much she was the love interest and ultimately the mother of the tyrant and that pretty much sums up her relevance in the dune saga she is still all that of course but while she loves paul shes an outspoken cynic concerning him being a messiah this was a welcome changestilgar is exactly what he was at the end of the first book but all that throughout i am mildly disappointed nevertheless he is the most comedic characterpaul kills the baron chani breaks up with him kinda the door is wide open for part those are the most significant changes from the book i would encourage anyone to watch it and not allow these to detract from your enjoymenteveryone did a great job on the film as a whole and of course its a,positive
322,id suggest revisiting the first movie because this sequel picks up right where we left off in the dune universe from the beginning youre thrust back into the chaotic unpredictable and perilous world of arrakis the action is swift and meticulously planned keeping you engaged from start to finish what i appreciated about the first film carries over seamlessly into the sequel despite being a scifi movie it doesnt feel like one even without the scifi action and special effects it remains a compelling immersive and grounded storytelling experience clocking in at hours and odd minutes the movie flies by with not a single wasted moment the narrative flows effortlessly maintaining organized chaos and hitting all the necessary beats along the way given that its a sequel you might expect a dropoff but thats simply not the case every actor on screen from timothy and zendaya to josh brolin and austin butler along with the other talented individuals delivered exceptional performances each of them was on point and effectively brought the story to life another standout aspect is hans zimmers score each note propels the narrative with intent effectively enhancing the atmosphere of every scene zimmers mastery is evident in his ability to employ the same theme across various emotional contexts while weve heard the theme repeatedly this film allows us to experience it in different emotional nuances depending on the onscreen events while its still early in this film should definitely be considered an oscar contender next year dune part effectively concludes the first of six books in the expansive dune saga part of me is eager to see the next installment on screen but if this marks the end im good with that too considering the saga gets a little weird from here a big thank you to amc theatres and wb for the opportunity to experience this in imax tonight i highly recommend a premium format because the immersive sound truly enhances the viewing experience im already looking forward to watching this again great flick,positive
323,from start to end the world this movie is bringing to life will leave your eyes wide open throughout the movie if youre a scifi lover there wont be a second you wont be left in awe watching the movie was like going through best moments of your own life when you think that this is the climax there comes another the soundtrack will leave you a heart full of emotions when you leave the theatre it doesnt fail to deliver the universe it promiseddunei was just the staircase after you watch this you will be at the platform where the throne sits look forward to watch the next movie from the throne,positive
324,a love story to the original trilogythis is how you make a movie out of a book for all future movie makers out there while there are divergencies from the books it thematically follows and still captures the heart of the corruption of power religion ecological transformation ethics war and violence that frank herbert played on in his masterpiece the multiple shots sometimes only a few seconds that paid tribute to conversations and interplay within the books was excellent i wish they had had time to include the full story given how beautifully choregraphed each scene is but its already almost hours and somethings just have to be cutit impressively does all this while still spending enough time on character building and capturing the plan within a plan within a plan just well done i hope there will be an extended trilogy cut in the future perhaps someone will even make the sequelsprequels in the future,positive
325,i thought dune part was amazing but denis villeneuve cranked out a masterpiece with part every moment was spellbinding the cinematography epic the acting authentic and the world building was astonishingthey made changes form the book sure but the changes they made fit in with the tone of the narrative zendayas chani is strong yet feminine and you feel both her growth and her struggle throughout the film timothe chalamet shines as paul he conveys a quiet strength throughout the film and you believe his struggles as well as his ascent to leadership he earns it and owns it the rest of the cast brings their best to the film every character feels well livedinthe film is truly visually breathtaking so many wonderful directing choices i love that villeneuve allows us to linger in scenes to extend the feeling of each world as you visit them you feel like you have a sense for the dune universe simply though the visual and sound spaceshollywood this is what we want heroic masculine and feminine characters good writing and pacing authenticity this is how you do it right dune should be a guidebook for the rest of the industry,positive
326,watched it first day and honestly i expected the movie would be great but my god i was wrong this was beyond greatness the movie was literally a masterpiece i went to the theater expecting the movie to be or but this was a i loved everything about this movie and i wish i could watch it again for the first time and you guys those who havent watched it yet have that privilege do watch it in a theater because this is the best theater experience of the decade watch it in k dolby atmos or atleast watch it in a theater with good sound and audio quality this movie is a goosebump fest,positive
327,while i will say it was vibrant and visually captivating and also very well done soundtrack however the story was dulled by acting i didnt find believable it was similar to an over budget day time soap overall pretty good i wouldnt say its an adult film and main characters had more of a highschool teenie bop feel hard to believe as an adult those were warriors or leaders supporting cast was amazing except christopher walken sounded like he stepped out of a newyork deli in the s zero clue how that wasnt supposed to stick out everyone had different accents and his was outrageous,positive
328,i had instants of goosebumps running through my body more times than i can count it was an absolute thrill to watch everything is carefully executed from the music to the visuals it is all pure magic and so beautiful to watch the dynamics of power beliefs and the environment makes the backdrop for the plot so captivating the movie was so magical that i completely lost track of time and thus feared that the movie would suddenly end because i could not get enough of it the movie was everything it needed to be and was a perfect adaptation that will probably become one of my all time favorites,positive
329,and were back following theexperimentthat was s dune denis villanueve is back with the sequel like the first one this is a perfectly crafted piece of sci fi filmmaking however unlike the first dune dune is not a total snoozer as things actually happen on screen this time around the shots the music the sound design are all top notchi still find myself baffled by these movies again i am the super ultimate target audience for weird sci fi stuff and i love most of denis villanueves work even with all of the whiz bang taking place in dune i still found myself yawning at times i cant keep track of any of the characters names i have only a basic understanding of who is doing what i am not mesmerised by timothee chalamet nor zendayas acting they both seem kind of wooden to me also by about the th or th time they push in for a super close up on zendayas weird face and linger there for what seemed like hours on end i began to grow wearyi dont know i think i must be the problem everyone else in the world seems to love these same movies so i must be some sort of freak or miscreantto me this is an amped up version of the first dune more battles and action more sand more death its just more,positive
330,omg where do i even begin how can you transform a great book with great former adaptations and turn it into a boring af waste of timethere is no tension no convincing acting and the pace will make you fall asleepthe casting was made with pleasing the crowds in mind and not with the story timothy has the magnetism of plastic and the pairing with zendaya feels forced and boringthe magical and mystical elements of the book are completely missing or underplayed as are the political motivations there is no pending feelings of doomalso it feels more like a movie set in ancient arabia rather than in space in summary save yourself time and money and watch the version instead,positive
331,contrasts with marvel and star wars in that it takes itself completely seriously there is no humor which allows the intensity to build and lets the world building be immersive similar in some ways to batman movies like the batman or the dark knightit was a nice experience i gave it a because asking for more from a movie is unreasonablevery fast paced similar to infinity war full of action there isnt much in the way of day to day scenes at hr i dont see any way around that in moviethe chosen one motif seems well suited to cinema since it allows telling a big story while following one man but its definitely disconnected from reality,positive

333,never before have i been this excited for the release of a film when the delay from november to march for part twos release happened it devastated me but now it is here i was able to see it almost a week early and it did not disappoint i am an avid fan of the books so i will say that most of my criticisms or slight complaints come from wishing to see scenes and characters from the book adapted on to screen but at the same time most if not all of these changes make for a better paced and probably less cluttered final productthe cinematography once again is stunning the gorgeous sands of arrakis mixed with the colors of different times of day the larger than life presence of the sandworms the dismal and brutal gray of giedi prime the various sietches and places of the fremen all of it looks gorgeous the hanz zimmer score returning capturing perfectly the atmosphere of this desert planet loved all of itthe performances of characters evolve most notably timothee as he becomes paul muadib and lady jessica as she takes on role of reverend mother zendaya as chani gives muchneeded depth to that character from the book javier as stilgar was incredible each performance was fantastic dave bautista also shines in his role as beast rabban i could go on and on about each performance but another well done aspect of this filmif you enjoyed dune part one in any capacity and long to see where the story of paul atreides and the harkonnens goes from here you will definitely enjoy this film as the pacing feels very quick and action packed and the worldbuilding from part one makes it all pay off hereso many scenes from this part two took my breath away and i think denis did an incredible job adapting the second half of this epic story despite several changes from the source material i will definitely see this film again and again so i can relive this incredible cinematic experience and if you havent already definitely give the books a try and i look forward to the next chapter dune messiah,positive
334,dune and are the greatest works in cinema history let me explain dune is based on frank herberts scifi novel but in this combo it speaks about politics the use of religion as a political tool for manipulating the masses it delves into ecology and within all that it intertwines the romance of paul atreides and chani which challenges politics and the empire its a story that demands an extremely complex adaptation for a film that combining both parts runs around minutes but denis villeneuve managed to capture the essence of frank herberts literary work and gave us the best scifi film in history,positive
335,this movie was an absolute masterpiecethe first one was extremely good and then denis just blew me away with the sequel i dont even know how many times i got the goosebumps it was everything i hoped it would bethe only two things that could have made me rate it a instead of would be the lack of vulnerability from zendayas character would have loved to se her open up a bit more especially around paul instead of almost only the tough impression she has going on the introduction and portraying of emperor shaddam could have been a bigger thing like baron harkonnen and the way he is being portrayedi will gladly pay to watch it a second time in the theater to be honestwhat an experience loved it,positive
336,what a movie one of the best i have ever seen it was all i wanted and more the visuals the sound the acting the dialogue they are all at their highest absolutely spectaculari strongly recommend seeing it in a cinema the movie is great but the cinema experience amplifies that gratenessi know the source material was really good to start with but the way the director captured the storyline built the characters and delivered it all to the audience is simply a masterpiecei think the pace of the movie was perfect slow at the times we wanted to savor the moments fast enough through the rest and constantly intenseand even though we are introduced to quite a bunch of new characters they are all given enough time for the audience to understand who they are and what is their role in the storymore of this please,positive
337,i liked the overall pacing of things much better in the first part i can compare pretty well because i watched the first part night before the second part first half is filled with dialogue then second half is very rushed ironically i think this movie works much better on small screen than on imax where i saw this just because there is so much dialogue and actually not that much of visually impressive scenes which would work better on imaxfeels like they used the time in less important places sardukan are suddenly poor cannon fodder instead of empires finest fighters paul and his savvy mates taking suddenly harvesters with gadgets they just suddenly happen to have nothing is explained via moving pictures not anything like how they organize the strikes against harkonen or how they happen to have weapons of different variety and so on things just happen suddenly just because its conventional paul walks to different places without virtually any kind of resistance or drama just so that he can convey some lines which should be meaningful for the viewer as it was in the first part they dont really show the view of harkonens i liked the dynamic between the harkonen baron and rabban in the first movie even though that they did gave very little of time for that side of the story in the first part but they give even less time in this moviei expected at least something to really stand out in a production of this scale but nothing really stands out not writing not actor performances not music nothing the movie is kind of nice to see how things developed from the first part but thats pretty much it thats why for me this movie is,positive
338,i just saw the new movie dune part two and i was speechlessit was amazing full of creativity and an unforgettable actionfrom the sensational footage which i will constantly praise to the story and everything that the dune universe meansshocking scenes dramatic scenes romantic scenes but also full scenes full of action carnage and explosionssomething ive been waiting for so long and it was more perfect than i expectedin imax the sound was so good that at any explosion or need for bass it creates a shock an earthquake that gives incredible pleasureyou must see it and i declare that it is the best film of and i dont think that any of the upcoming movies will be better waiting for oscars and all the wins possible,positive
339,i was really looking forward to this and while it was good i wasnt blown away i question some of the casting christopher walken really and the sense of timing pace seemed off a lot was not explained well and i felt it skipped around too much and spent too much time on atmospheric moments when a bit more story building was called for even the iconic moment of riding the sandworm seemed a bit rush and then when the moment arrived it was a bit of a let down dont get me wrong visually appealing and great technical work but the story which was written by a grand master of science fiction was given short shift hard to believe that in an almost hour movie a lot of what made dune great was given rudimentary mention or skipped all together whats with the hype anna taylor joy she had a what second clip a lot of skilled actors barely had any screen time or fulfilling character arcs more good have been done i liked it but ive read the books multiple times someone with no history of the books would likely be confused lets hope the story takes a more prominent place in part,positive
340,this is one of those films that is overrated by a whole stars because people who dont get it or fall asleep blame themselves rather than the film their inclination is to follow the herd or the emperor in this case only problem is that the emperor has no clothes its a cultural phenomena whereby if something seems or has the pretence of being intelligent half the population is scared to call it out as dumbits just a bunch of nonsense arthouse type scenes thrown together without any particular order or purpose and they could do some decent cgi because thanks to the abundance of sand there is really very little on screen at any one timetheres really nothing else here and nothing that works,positive
341,i would say that my expectations going into the movie were somewhat high the book is highly loved and i enjoyed the first movie greatly and yet it blew my mind one of my first thoughts coming out of the theater was how it compared to empire strikes back i mean could this have been better maybe it certainly gave me more goosebumps it was more visually stunning and had a soundtrack that while not as iconic certainly feels more true to the atmosphere of the movie it had been a long time since a scifi made me forget i was watching a movie the movie has three strengths the beginning the middle and the end although the beginning and end were definitely my favorite now im just crying thinking about waiting for part three,positive
342,this was my most anticipated movie of i finally watched it in the theater on tuesday this was literally everything that i wanted it to be more dune part two is one of the greatest movies that ive ever seen in my life as well as one of the best movie theater experiences of my lifeeverything about the filmmaking in this movie was absolutely perfect the acting writing directing special effects cinematography musical score wre executed to perfection from start to finish denis villeneuve has once again proven why he is one of the best filmmakers in the business todayinconclusion dune part two is the best movie that ive seen in so far i dont see any other movie dethroning it from my spot go out watch it buy it,positive
343,saw this film yesterday and i was completely blown away it takes every element from the first and increases it xevery single scene was pure perfection the soundtrack and characters were also i went into this movie thinking it was gonna be good but it was way over my expectationsthis movie quickly landed on my top movies of all time its truly incredible and denis villeneuve has an incredible mind for making something like this its a one of a kind movie nothing else to compare this withi was completely hooked from start to finish only one thing to say about this movieprepare to be completely blown away,positive
344,dune part is basically a build up for this part and oh boy was that build up worth the wait this is what you expect a sequel to do not only follow up the story but surpass it which this movie definitely achievedevery actor and actress nailed their roles its acted to perfection has breathtaking visuals the soundtrack is amazingits a prefect recipe for a blockbuster but apart from that it also has a really good storyline with themes such as consequences of war prophecies and hope and what it does to a man timothee chalamet absolutely nailed the role of paul atreidiesi was grinning through the entirety of the last minutes after so many attempts of mediocrity we finally have a movie that does justice to frank herberts work and space opera genre,positive
345,breath taking inspiring taken away full blast everything is so powerful i was flabbergasted deliciously for hourswhat a movie this is why i love going to the theater being moved taken away i poored some tears i got the chills i smiled i felt it those hours spent so fastim now longing for dune what a cast what a scenario everything was natural and flawless i rarely write reviewsi also recommend watching part again before going to the next chaptergreat adaption of the book go and see that movie pleaseeventually i went to the grand rex the infinite in parislovely morning,positive
346,after coming home from watching this in imax all i want it is to go back i was both elated and grieved when the atomics went off and when feyd rautha fights paul why because i knew the end of the story was coming i couldnt get enough denis pulls off the spectacle and the story in such a marriage of wonder that it would be wise that no attempt is ever made again to make this book into a movie this is the book every character is solid totally sold on every actors portrayal of their character author butler was a malevolent masterpiece timothee chalamet truly shows us paul the teenage child grow into the lisan al gaib this is going to be the canonical trio of this generation just as star wars was of the past nothing better,positive
347,this is a truly amazing movie that showcases villeneuves artistry on multiple levels many storytelling choices that deviate from the book were actually smart so a lot of thought definitely went into the script but somehow the big picture got lostwhat i found very evocative in the first dune film by villeneuve was pauls struggle with his mothers vision for his life it formed a kind of emotional core in the movie which suited the format perfectly when you spend hours in the cinema you expect a certain story arcthis theme is obviously also a major red thread in the books and so continues in part two but all the spectacular imagery music and ethos does not make up for the rather wooden character development of paul timothe chamalet is a fantastic actor so you follow the story anyway the film would have been so much stronger though if his evolution from troubled teen to messianic warlord were just a little more carefully crafted in the scriptthis shortcoming is also visible in pauls relationship with chani on many levels their romance is very plausible and compelling towards the end of the film the mystery wrapped around pauls destiny inevitably comes between them but there is so much storytelling potential in this emotional timebomb that just seems to fall flatbesides these and other minor flaws there are so many reasons to see this film some of my favorite moments are delivered by the actors rebecca ferguson lady jessica zendaya chani stellan skrsgard baron harkonnen and the chilling austin butler feydrautha,positive
348,for me best mouvie i have ever seen wonderfully act and produced perfect in every way thank you for this masterpiece the way action it drives you the way you live thru the eyes of every character the way you feel emotions rage and love it truly unique and for sure every film enthusiast must see dune ii i really love denis villeneuve and all his movies and for me this one is the best till know i am ready happy to have the opportunity to see in cinema a mouvie like this witch transcends images with imotions music is perfect sound is impressive in every way at the end you leave from cinema full of energy and i think this is the most important,positive
349,the visual and auditory spectacle is brilliant but dune is about the journey of self realization the central core of dune is around the sleeper must awaken dialogue which is not captured in both parts only david lynchs movie captures that essencei would urge everyone to watch david lynch version before thisalso some scenes are very anticlimatic certain characters have been downpoured into something they are not as seen in part one some scenes have been elongated way too much and some scenes requiring more context have been cut shortdune book series is an epic an epic needs nurturing of all characters even if the movie is nurturing only the central character the essence of the character is missing,positive
350,i enjoyed the movie overall but found myself questioning so much of what was going on events were being half told with the watcher being required to assume the restas someone who truly enjoys this genre and the original movie i was really looking forward to this set of movies when it was first announced after watching the first movie i had fears that it would not live up to the hypei enjoyed the action sequences and overall production quality of the movies but there always seemed to be something missing without giving too much away there a scene where the main character paul was training to survive in the desert they gave the impression that he was to learn it and survive a day next thing you know zendeya character showing him how its done yet only one scene passes then magically the whole thing is over and the next seen the training has been completed without any results or spoken words about how he did a congratulation or anything expect this type of storytelling to continue through the moviesin the part two movie paul is stabbed in the breast region and then moments later the knife is in his shoulder not even on the same side of the body as stated there is no real consistency in this set of films i almost felt like i was watching another movie based off the same storyi didnt care for timothee as an actor in the first movie he never at any point gave off a quality of strength or courage in part two he did better but his character just wasnt all that likeable ive never seen timothee in any other films so i am not sure if this is an cast issue or a director issue zendeya was also a poor fit she is a very mediocre actress her character was also meant to be a strong character within her people but i got more of an outcast gossip girl i hsve never seen zendeya in anything else but spiderman and didnt really care for her as the character there eitheri will say that overall as a huge fan of the genre there were moments i truly enjoyed but it was the weak moments about the movie that ruined it for me of the space opera genre flicks i found rebel moon which was also a mediocre film was better than this not only were they not as long but they were paced much better i rewatch films often but i dont see myself coming back to watch this one ever again,positive
351,better than anything marvel star wars or dc has put out since the s avengers feels like peppa pig compared to this honestly hahahaas good as a dark knight but even more epicin a league of its ownit was best movie experience of my life the film builds perfectly leaves you pumped and heartbroken at the same time i had no problems with walken as emperor in a universe where every character is either intense crazy or over the top i liked that the emperor is calm and discreet the whole cast is great shout out to javier bardem being a perfect comic relief chalamet is impressive zendaya rebeca austin everybody did a great jobhans zimmer shines again and denis villeneuve is already one of the great filmmakers of this century it will not surprise me if in time he is considered one of the best to ever do it,positive
352,when dave bautista told the only way to watch dune part two was in imax i assumed it was some marketing gimmick but boy i was wrong the depths in sound design from sheer silence to astronomical collisions it was fookin brilliant hans zimmer bravo denis villeneuves maturity in film making is displayed in an opulent scale like no other all his previous gems sicaro arrival blade runner prepared him for this movie frames are sculpted like art in de silver screens especially that colosseum fight under the black sun or the final duel paying tribute to the original version shivers down my spine woof baby thats the bar ryt theretimothe chalamet chose the right film to be the protagonist setting his own milestone in hollywood and greig fraser chose the ryt director bringing a grandiose vision to life,positive
353,quite literally a one of a kind movie i came in expecting greatness and it still exceeded any and all of my preconceptionshow villeneuve manages to keep story setting sound and soul consistent throughout this otherworldly space opera is beyond me and i am simply happy we finally get to share in its greatness apart from the fact that towards the ending some of the scenes feelt a bit rushed death of rabban the arrival and defeat of the emperor there were no cracks in the impenetrable armour of dune i could keep going for words but simply believe me when i tell you you need to see this film,positive
354,dune part two is a kind of movie that makes some of you people think ummanother h m long movie might feel boring but after you finished watching it you just wish that it was longer than thatyes i wanted moredenis villeneuve crafted his dune world so beautifully that you cant resist going back you started watching it and you instantly feel yourself locked up with the screen the level of detail in every frame is crazy stunning from the religious fremens to brutal harkonnens every single tribe has their own recognition you can differ them by their gorgeous costumes their culture their own living spaces dune is justice to frank herberts novel and all of that was possible because denis was selected as the director he lead the crew and handled every sector very professionally that the outcome is unbelievably epicthanks to cinematographer greig frasermusician hans zimmer and his teamproduction designer patrice vermettecostume designers and the vfx artistthey bought this out of the world vision of denis villeneuve to lifenow i want dune part three messiah and i want it to be hour long,positive
355,just perfect the story line the actors the sound the image the best movie ever all action it s perfect played and you can t wait to find out whats next to hapen and when all hapen the sensations on your mind and body starts to vibrate in the same rithm as you call for it the image and the sound ar just pure art that describe perfectly the story line and what eache character live every second in pefevt symbiose without any logical break you cannot stop love it you just want more to see every second of it it just to good you are realy inaide this epic univers inside thei familys,positive
356,this film really satisfied me after the somewhat boring treat in the previous film this film was like an outlet very elegant and clever moves to avenge what happened in the previous film i liked the character development of the antagonist but all the actors and actresses played their roles very well the music composed by hans is beyond doubt dont forget i want the highest appreciation to the party responsible for the cgi its been a long time since ive seen a film with subtle cgi like this however perhaps the thing that needs to be improved is that the one by one scenes are not shown intensely and optimally this film deserves appreciation from the audience not just professional critics good work for denis and everyone extraordinary,positive
357,i was super hyped to watch the movie there are very few if any films with this high a rating i dont get it why is this bit now in black and white i really struggled to watch it literally nothing happens theres a gladiator remade scene which was odd its a bit of a mish mash of stuff while slick and fantastically well made its a bit boring i dont care about the characters the guy from guardians of the galaxy basically plays the same comic role which i dont know if this wasnt intentional humour but the best bit in a very serious moviechristopher walken looks like hes going to say where am i any moment sort of looks a bit lostoverall stunning visuals truly epic but for hours very little happens and the mix of styles is a bit confusing the characters are a bit sterile and the story takes too long to unfold,negative
358,caught the sneak preview last night of dune how do you put in words the magnificence of a film theres been many through time but this one just set the bar i believe first off youve got to see it on imax i dont know if the smaller screen would have the same feeling the effects are seamless theres nothing else to say about that and the story is complete from start to finish but the thing that really sets it apart is the music and sound design holding hands with the effects and cinematography its powerful there were moments when i found myself mesmerized by the effects and sound and lost track of the story a bit but the phenomenal performances by timothee chalamet and austin butler brought me right back and were quite impressive zendaya was equally amazing i dont want to give much away but there are some beautiful nods to the very first dune that david lynch directed and i think its actually better than the first dune denis villeneuve did he is simply a genious,positive
359,by ian chandler march dune part two is a largely remarkable scifi spectacle that benefits greatly from the buildup of its fantastic predecessor continuing almost directly after the first part the film reinvites viewers to the atmospheric entrancing world of arrakis in the shoes of paul now accompanied with the fremen also complementing the film is the score this soundtrack composed by hans zimmer enhances the films overall mood even so it is not a particularly memorable one the cinematography is one of the pictures greatest highlights providing stunning visuals that are certainly going to be on display for those k televisions on sale the first act is mysterious and tense the set pieces and plot points are both otherworldly and eerie it glues ones eyes to the screen and refuses to let them gocharacter development is a large focus throughout the film and the world of arrakis is further explored timothee chalamet is talented in the lead role giving in convincing emotion without going overboard zendaya plays the role of chani though her portrayal here is similar to another character she played michelle watson several other alist actors light the screen as well austin butler in particular does a phenomenal job as an incredibly frightening villain stellan skarsgrds talent as the baron also returns with the same sinister energy found in the preceding film the remaining actors do a well job at their roles but are lacking in screen time to give too much of an impressionwith the aboveaverage acting the appropriate score and the exceptional cinematography the first two hours are excellent the last thirty minutes unfortunately are a weak point the pacing is thrice in speed and unspecified aspects feel lazier than they should this was also a problem in its source material and it is a shame to see no improvement in the movie released nearly sixty years after it is no dealbreaker even so it does hamper the films overall quality by no small margindune part two the film is ambitious atmospheric and wellacted but its third act goes at the speed of a bullet train,positive
360,people rating this above most probably never read the book something i did more than times over the last years this was always at least for me one of the scifi masterpieces with a storyline that was almost sacredpart was sublime in terms of character development pace and adherence to the storyline compared with this part a dismal failure of discrete battle scenes one dimensional characters and a serious deviation from the storyline in my view they tried to stretch the success of the first movie into a third installment for commercial reasons and in the process butchered part i will not waste time on any followup installments,positive
361,only thing wrong with this masterpiece is the pronunciation of harkonnen why pronounce it like it was finnish otherwise it was unbelievably amazing to watch everything from the score to the storytelling so close and yet so far from the original from cant wait for the third installment of this epic story one thing is missing though the wierding way was not in the movie at all that was puzzling to me and the worms was not scary as they were in the original but i will recommend this movie simply because it is a truly masterpiece worth seeing so dont miss out enjoy this story and be amazed,positive
362,that was a once in a lifetime event a great movie i think i will be watching in cinema for a second time the acting is really great and also the progress of the character i never think the movie was too long time passing by it feels never so long there are also breathtaking thrilling moments the effects are marvelous costumes fits perfectlywhat can i say else im waiting for a very long time to see a movie like this in the last months maybe year i watched very less movies because there is not so much too see that dont feel like trash i want more films like this one hi to cinema watch ityou will not regret,positive

364,first and foremost the movie is a masterpiece the vast majority of the poor reviews come from hardcore book fans disclaimer im one complaining about variations from the book i wont elaborate on details to avoid spoilers but what needs to be understood is that it is a different media decisions were made by villeneuve to suppress elements that are present on the book to allow a better flow of the story without compromising its main plotline he has succeeded in my opinion including all the components of the book would inevitably lead to underdeveloped storylines another reason for one of his most criticized decisions is obviously technical yes im talking about a certain key book character that appears in a different way in the movie this character would have to be done in cgi or with an actor dubbing another i believe both outcomes would be subpar in comparison with how it was handledfor those who have not seen the movie having read the books or not go make sure you select the biggest available screen i went for imax and buckle up for the ride enjoy your trip to arrakis,positive
365,appreciate that everyone is entitled to their opinion so heres mine anyone giving this less than a solid needs to reevaluate themselves as a person because you either have no imagination or are just generally a negative human this film has everything and is a modern day great easily the best cinematic experience ive ever had comparable to films like the dark knight trilogy and the original star wars filmsfor a nearly three hour long film basically nobody got up to go for a toilet break and the entire time i felt totally present gripped by itdont listen to anyone on here leaving poor reviews go and watch the film and see the magic for yourself,positive
366,hear me out i love scifi and denis villeneuve is very skilled at creating dune pt blade runner and arrival now we have dune pt which i just saw in imax at an early screening last night it is as you might expect a technical marvel with a stacked cast who all bring their agame like the two towers or empire strikes back it expands on the lore worldbuilding develops the main characters and introduces new ones most of what was set up on the story and character front is paid off to some degree here the battle sequences are incredible and creative in places i think its safe to say that if you liked the first movie youll like this one but its easier to admire than to love with the characters at arms length even by the time the credits rolled keep in mind that while the movie is very good it still has pacing issues and is too long in fact there is so much going on here that it feels like two movies worth this is not as great as the hype makes you believe masterpiece next lotr etc but as a sequel to dune it works well enough to entertain while suffering from that middlechapter syndrome that most second chapters do,positive
367,i know im going to get flack for this i loved the movie highly entertained the entire time but it isnt the kind of movie i will want to see over and over the source material is amazing the creativity is off the charts the directing is brilliant and i dont use that word lightlybut the characters arent having any fun and they arent fun to watch all of my favorite scifi movies have likable characters star wars had han and luke and leigh with a side of chewy terminator had arnold and linda hamilton alien had sigourney this movie just leaves you with an overall sense of dread its not fun the characters arent having any fun which made me feel like i wasnt having any fun,positive
368,best cinematic experience of my life so far absolutely astonishing long live the fighters hans zimmers soundtrack leaves a lasting impression that sticks with you long after you leave your seat the performance from each member of the cast were uniquely mesmerizing and powerful the sheer scale of this film surpasses anything ive ever witnessed and is a testament to the quality and craftsmanship of denis villeneuve the stark contrast of paul from the first to last act is astonishing i cant quite yet get to grips with how this film has affected me this will go down as a core memory for me seeing this in cinema and not waiting for it to be available on a streaming platform cinema is alive and thank you all for this amazing experience,positive
369,like the prequel this movie is a technical masterpiece stunning cinematography and the soundscape is extremely well composedbut what is has in spades on the technical front it severely lacks on other fronts unlike the prequel this movie takes several departures from the book most of which im not entirely sure why and some seems downright uncharacteristic as an example chanis disbelief in the prophecy i get that the persuasion of the fremen is a key in the story and this is a way to highlight it further but her being in love with paul and then not believing in him or supporting him at all at times directly disrespecting him seems very irrationalin general the characters felt shallow and i had no engagement in them whatsoever i dont think timothee chalamet was well cast as paul acting was overall decent but there somehow was something missing in terms of character depth and development i think it comes down to the pacing of the movie example when paul needs to learn to ride the worms one scene is stilgar telling him it requires a lot to master next scene is literally paul riding the biggest worm they have ever seenthe storytelling also completely fails to convey the complexity of the political system the role of spice and how each player tries to take advantagein the end a grand attempt at translating a classic book that ultimately falls short on character depthdevelopment and overall storytelling that said still very much above your average hollywood action flick,positive
370,going fresh from finishing dune part two ill let this be a continuation of my review of part oneits visually a very amusing movie starts of fresh with at least some amount of storythe expectations are high compared to i gave part one and they keep being high for like of the movieand at that point you start giving up you realize theres no big reveal coming nothing unexpected or at least resembling a story that evolveswhen ive been so critical in part one mainly because of the huge cliffhanger it ends on my friend said just you wait for part twowell i did and i still cant see the appeal for a movie that tried but was over hyped and a proof that you cant turn a bad book into a good movie,positive
371,i had pretty sky high expectation with this film and this film somehow exceeded them greatly this is an epic grand story that needs to be experienced on the biggest screen possible from the visuals to the sound design acting story this is truly the lord of the rings of this generation this film focuses on the second half of the book which has all of the big war scenes and this film is honestly adapted a little more loosely from the book compared to the first part which i thought was brilliantly adapted zendaya really steals the show with her performance along with everybody else in this film even if you didnt like the first dune trust me youll fall in love with this one,positive
372,i just experienced an early access showing and i have to say it was mindblowing seriously do yourself a favor and catch it in imax the characters acting screenplay worldbuilding storytelling score action sequences cinematography you name it its all topnotch denis villeneuve really outdid himself its like a masterclass in filmmaking the casting choices were spoton from start to finish and the new additions just elevated everything timothee chalamet nailed it as paul atreides so believable raw and real he owned that lead role zendaya rebecca ferguson javier bardem and josh brolin were all fantastic as usual stellan skarsgard and dave bautista continued to bring the evil vibes austin butler stole the show as feydrautha and florence pugh and christopher walken added a solid freshness to the castin a nutshell dune part two is an aweinspiring visually stunning scifi masterpiece that seamlessly blends myth adventure and destiny on a galactic scale its a rare gem of filmmaking something you dont see often in todays cinema landscape,positive

377,dune part is a remarkable technical achievement that blends the line between arthouse cinema and a commercial blockbuster and continues to raise the standard for scifi epic cinemadirector denis villeneuve ups the spectacle factor delivering largescale desert action sequences against a romping hans zimmer score greg frasiers breathtaking cinematography continues to reach new heightsit takes tremendous artistry and effort to find depth and shadow in a perpetually flat and bland desert i tried to photograph a desert on holiday recently its bloody difficultthe spice presented as fine sparkling orange grain sprinkled in sand is sumptuous and addictive to look at the sandworm riding sequence in imax is spectacular periodas paul atriedes timothy chalamet convincingly transitions from a boy into a fullfledged leader with a hard edge and grit the central theme of being a messiah for the support of the masses for personal gain without true faith in the cause is richly fascinatingand yet dune part two is a less engaging experiencepart two uses the pacing of a commercial blockbuster to cover a bigger chunk of its ambitious story having rewatched the first dune an hour before seeing the second the pacing was jarringwhats gone is the lingering mood from the first dune where the shots were held a bit too long and slowly immersed the audience into its world there was a metaphysical quality to pauls contradictory visions that was compelling the mood was delivering all the emotionsnow these wistful moments are shortened and traded for plot points it is delivered like summarized informationim aware im in the minority and the stylistic transition worked for most people which is great i just left the theater exhaustedundesirably i might addperhaps its the nature of the source material itself frank herberts book is embedded with lots of scattered themes the challenge of adapting it theatrically will always be choosing parts of it and condensing it into something cohesivethe first dune captured my imagination more deeply it was like slowly walking into a world with culture history and intimate access into the characters inner thoughts part two retained some of those qualities no doubt but nows theres an usher hurrying me along to keep the line moving,positive
378,i was blessed to watch the early fan premier of the movie and was left nearly speechless every scene is crafted with care and love from the director crew and actors the story choices made by villeneuve work to perfection every actor took a step up in their performances from dune the only reaction i could muster walking out of the theater was that dune now feels like a movie that was held back and filtered because dune is everything to percent but above all the movieviewing experience in a big theater is on par with the most epic and satisfying films of all time even if a viewer doesnt care about the story this movie is a true spectacle on the big screen,positive
379,on the visual and audio side of things this is a tour de force watched in imax and this move must have used the subwoofers more than all other movies combined your seat is shaking from battles and worms its almost too much to take at timesand visually its a masterpiece both in fidelity and in the set and costume design not a single feeling of green screen cgi bonanzabut story and character wise while not bad its just not that engaging you are never surprised a problem with sticking close to the well known story theres a little character development but i would have wanted to see pauls change with more gradual tension and the second half seems very rushed with a lot of big events just thrown in without a lot of reason suddenly if feels like avengers and every fremen is a superhero maybe thats a problem with the original story,positive
380,no chemistry between the leads why is the emperor army so weak they got destroyed in like min how could they conquer and colonise this planet for thousands of year why they have laser guns but still fight with swords emperor and harkonnen army should know this planet well since they ruled for s of year yet they got surprised and beaten by the worm they should know and react better what do freeman people eat they live in slums dont work and eat nothing all the characters are just so utterly pretentious the conversations are also pretentious and meaningless there are literally no progress in min you wouldnt miss anything if you fell asleep the mother has lots of screen time but does not make any difference aside from trying to hype her son up thats all the worm is ridiculous part its scary and now everyone riding it like a toy how tk they hook into the worm and put everyone onboard fight scene with the spice miners is so dumb why not use the big gun immediately to take it down or best use the worm and ride it over why run so many people directly at the army no tactics at all but yet hes praised like a hero the freeman people without guns can take on the whole emperor and harkonnen army easily non sense,positive
381,despite its long runtime i was on the edge of my seat for most of this film the action the drama the character development even the romance it was all incredible see it on the largest screen possible to maximize the viewing experience timothee chalamet was perfect as paul its hard to believe the sweet boy from the first dune was able to transform into the muad dib but he did completely zendaya was fierce as chani and austin butler chewed the scenery as feydrautha i cant wait to see it again and i eagerly await new of the filming of messiah but i first i guess i better read it,positive
382,the film picks up seamlessly from where the first part left off with paul atreides embracing his destiny as the messianic figure known as muaddib as paul navigates arrakis he faces new challenges and discovers himself together with the enigmatic fremen warrior chani whose relationship with paul deepens amidst the turmoil of revolutionvisually stunning and meticulously crafted transporrted me to the desolate yet enchanting world of arrakisthe cinematography captures the grandeur of the desert planet while also highlighting its harsh beautyin addition to its visual and narrative prowess dune part two also explores themes of power religion and identity with thoughtprovoking depth as paul grapples with his newfound status as a religious figurehead and the weight of his own destiny the movie raised compelling questions about the nature of leadership and the consequences of such poweroverall this was a masterful continuation of denis villeneuves ambitious adaptation delivering spectacle substance and emotional resonance in equal measure with stunning visuals compelling performances and rich thematic depth it was and always will be a must watch for me,positive
383,this is a return to big cinema that passionately screams the heightened possibilities of bigscale filmmaking dune part two is a masterful film in its ability to capture the imagination while scifi the only aliens you will encounter are the inhumane humans you are forced to accept as humans an alltime character study of the human race and its faults there is a power here that tasks the audience with quietcarride introspective questionshow does religious fanaticism corrupt mankind and how is this human condition controlledwhat does revenge mean and how far should one pursue it to what endwhen do hopeful beliefs turn into blind faith and does this inspire goodness evil or something else entirelywith this film denis villeneuve easily places him into the coveted conversation of the greatest scifi directors of all time here he crafts a world that oozes mythology and philosophy sprinkled with excellent action setpiecesextremely timely but timeless in its commentary of who man is not only a visual feast to enjoy but something that will leave you challenged something rarely experienced nowadays,positive

385,last mins is just pure goosebumps denis villeneuve proves that he is a next genius mind director after james camerontotally speechless no words to say theres a lot of stories going around in the film but the way director has managed the characters and the timings that they are in specially the political situation and then theres the magic realm all at once is not an easy job but denis villeneuve has done it and the film is remarkabledune ending has made a lot of suspecious about the half ending of the film specially it was also criticised by the people by not the proper ending but dune will make everyone quiet because the ending of the film is perfectly well balanced and its gives a hope of the next and the last one to comestory screenplay cinematography and other aspects top of the world specially the cgi of dune franchise is something else to witness that ive never witness before totally different from other filmscostumes visual presentation is outstanding no complaints there at allperformance are the also one of the big surprise of the film specially timothee chalamet zendaya rebecca ferguson austin butler a phenomenal performance by all of them with rest of the cast doesnt disappoint toodune will definitely give an experience that you havent witness specially in battle scenes the tensions that director build is just brilliant there should be more battle scenes or those were there in the film werent as long as the st part but still its justifies the film because the story has so much to tell as youll easily get invested into thatoverall a complete visual masterpiece just like the st one but with more story perfection and complexities youre gonna witness in this onea worth watch and give a imax experience because the visuals will just store your interest very well a highly recommended,positive
386,dune is perfect as the sequel it is equally engaging stylish serene and deliverer of exqusiteness in narratives a twisting climax and well made plot perhaps will go for part only will then make sense of the entire story from part waiting for part which i feel will be optimistic in whole but dont miss its prequel its a recommendationthe acting is good with all performers giving their best that creates unique characterization in scifi set up the technicals are top notch hans zimmer especially his work in scifi is unquestionably perfect just above the world dennis villeneuve too is one of the best upcoming director of science fiction genre his works appeals to what scifi really stands for the narratives and presentations are always appealing an expected liberator from injustices in the exoplanet having sand as the elixir of life mixing with political issues true love and and the bit pieces of religious propaganda forms the storyline the climax is not expected though but will make you think about the film the special effects the cgi the action scenes are all amazing to watch the introduction of the new antagony is good though a kinda fearsome and truly evildennis villeneuves dune is a franchise from scifi genre that would rank similar to the dark knight franchise in action genre and lord of rings franchise from fantasy genre summing up its a brilliant film with stunning visuals good storyline and impressive actions plus narrations the book lovers must give it a definite watch a,positive
387,i got really hyped up after reading some article stating that the film became the highest rated movie on imdb in history at that point the article mentioned a score which was crazyanyway yesterday i saw the movie at the cinemathe heros journey seemed too easy the first hours were slow and rather uneventful i enjoy scifi but i have seen much better of course that the scenery universe of dunes cinematic effects were amazing the leading role was really good as well but overall it was easy and lacked that real struggle uncertainty and surprizeit is worth seeing for sure but there are many elements that lack originality fights and plots that are lazy and rather without enough context preparation and coherencei appreciate the dune universe the heros evolution i like him because i find myself in him but as i said his evolution seemed written rather than deserved the scenery,positive
388,denis villeneuves dune part two arrives fulfilling the promise of its predecessor with stunning visuals epic action sequences and a deeper dive into frank herberts captivating universethe film is a feast for the eyes from the vast shimmering deserts of arrakis to the intricate designs of the fremen culture every frame is meticulously crafted and aweinspiring building on the foundation laid in part one the action is bigger bolder and more thrilling the sandworm battles are particularly impressive showcasing the immense power and scale of these creatures while the first half focuses heavily on worldbuilding the sequel delves deeper into character development we see paul atreides timothe chalamet grapple with his destiny lady jessica rebecca ferguson navigate the fremen power dynamics and chani zendaya emerge as a strong voice of reason the cast delivers strong performances across the board chalamet continues to impress as the conflicted paul while ferguson brings depth and complexity to lady jessica zendaya shines with her nuanced portrayal of chani and the supporting cast including javier bardem and josh brolin adds further weight to the narrativethe films first half feels rushed at times cramming in a lot of exposition to catch viewers up on plot points left unresolved in part one this can be jarring for those unfamiliar with the source material while visually stunning the film struggles to match the emotional weight of the first installment the complex themes of power destiny and ecological balance are present but not fully explored the film ends on a cliffhanger setting the stage for a potential third part while this may leave some viewers satisfied others might find it frustratingthe cinematography by greig fraser is magnificent capturing the vastness of arrakis and the intricate details of the fremen culture the score by hans zimmer is once again powerful and evocative adding to the films epic atmosphere the sound design is immersive placing viewers right in the heart of the actiondune part two is a visually stunning and actionpacked continuation of the epic saga while the pacing and emotional impact are not quite as strong as the first film the performances technical aspects and deeper exploration of the characters and world make it a worthwhile experience for fans of science fiction and grandscale storytelling however be prepared for a conclusion that leaves you wanting more,positive
389,this movie had some of the most impressive visual effects of any i have ever seen seeing it in imax was an experience that said i didnt love the story or the pacingi did not feel like the movie dragged on despite being almost hours but it was extremely choppy and important momentscharacter arcs were not well developed with hours of runtime i would have liked to see more development and explanationa few examples of this the scene were paul needs to navigate the desert alone this was supposed to be a major canonical event to show that he is the messiah he goes out alone is immediately met by zendaya and then the scene ends with no further discussion the worm riding was similarly undeveloped no training scenes etc the transformation of both paul and his mother they seem to both immediately jump into their new personas as soon as they drink the water i think it would have been more interesting to show them grow into their new roles or at least show some introspection about how abrupt the changes werea few other things i didnt love somehow the bald people cant defeat or even find the fremen but as soon as austin butler comes in he can find their shelter immediately and torch the whole thing the fremen have these op laser guns but are still relying on hand to hand combati think the movie could also have been a little more helpful to those of us who havent read the books by reiterating some of the lore and rules of the dune universe,positive
390,this was an awful waste of timeyes as everyone says its beautifully shot and looks gorgeousthats it though put the visuals to one side and theres little else to admirethe plot makes no sense and takes liberties just to keep things moving along at oh so pedestrian a pacechamalongadingdong and zendire have zero chemistry between them both good actors elsewhere but way off the mark here rather than a leader to be feared young tim looks like he just needs spanking and sending to bed with no supperwalken is tragically under utilised and looks lost in his brief appearances on screen given that hes supreme ruler of the universe or something the fremen lead by young tim all but just walk up to him and give him a telling offthe final battle is such a disappointment blink and youll miss it it could have been epic instead its a damp squib sandworms against the might of the harkonen army it could have been the best bit of the whole filmwont be holding my breath for part,positive
391,the perfect crescendo of dennis villanuevas directing career from the raw realism of combat in sicario to the beautifully immense alien vessels in arrival then the exotic and stunning world of blade runner which only lacked a depth of lore with regards to storytelling along with the incredible sound design in each of these films only lacking the originality of lightsabers clashing dune enters the room with the brilliantly crafted ornithopters the intricate crackle of the shields and the rattlesnake rumble of an incoming sand worm aside from this the cast is as perfectly selected as nolans batman trilogy making every character introduction a pleasant surprise and a nod of appreciation for choosing someone so well suited to how you personally imagined they would look and act next is the layers of storytelling and depth of plot that really take this movie into the realm of top on the top cementing villanueva in the mount rushmore of trilogy directors and second maybe only to christopher nolan throw a few lisan al gaib whispers into the chat and some arrakis dmt and you have a full fledged passion of the christ meets qui gon gin looking at anakin for the first time its honestly on another level,positive
392,born late to witness empire strikes back too young to understand the hype around return of the king but on time for dune part dune part is a peak cinematic experience specially in imax from the word go you are stuck into the sand of arrakis and a faith that messiah will save fremen from the violence of emperorevery scifi movie audience is prepared for the huge visual scenes battles action sequence but it happens rarely that dialogues are given this much importance and that where dune part prevails dune shows the importance of proper writing tight screenplay and visuals done rightcinematography specially in third act of the movie shows the scale of greig fraser and that scale is unimaginable crisp editing brilliant score by the hans zimmer are cherry on the toprebecca furguson and zendaya have given a performance of life time javier burdems performance as stalgir seems to be funny in first phase of the movie a faithful servant of the holy folks told about the messiah but as the movie goes by it slowly converts into the horror and that where javier bordem and josh brolins act seems legit and strongaustin butler is madness he shown his peak in those entry sequencesthere are no words that are enough to explain the timothee chalamat as messiah of fremen timothee as paul atredis is the best casting that has took place that shift from a hopeful prince to fearful leader of cult is amazingdenis villineuve is a brilliant director its his best work till datedune part deserves so many accolades this year watch this movie on the largest screen possible this movie will change the way we have seen cinema,positive
393,visually stunning gripping acting and an insane story this movie was actually so good i cried times at some of the beautiful shotsspoilers aheadthe worm riding scene was absolutely crazy and so memorable making me already want to rewatch just an hour after leaving the theater austin butlers performance was brilliant and the fight between him and paul just so good this may just become one of the top trilogies of all time competing with the likes of the lord of the rings and the original star wars films only time will tell but for now i am in awe with how much better it was than the first,positive
394,this was an utterly fabulous cinematic and spiritual experience i was drawn into villeneuves world by the enormous scale of the design the undeniable pull of a religious fable the conviction of the lead players and the power of the sound and visual designits strange how often critics pro or amateur think that sound and visuals are somehow a mere adjunct to the story that celebrity actors must all have something worthy to do cameos are derided that the politics of casting must be taken into account that all old stories must have a modern take to make them relevantcinema is moving pictures and whilst sound is not a requirement even silent era classics made good use of music and effects story is important but cinemas unique power is its capacity to move an audience by engaging two of our senses in a most primeval way story alone cannot do thisadmittedly ones hearing does feel at risk at times but without the awesome sound design dune part two would be diminished i was emotionally overwhelmed by the power of the movies visceral delivery this was not some sentimental response to the tale but a gut reaction to the physical transmission of the themes of power corruption revenge faith identity the spiritual battle of good and evil these were for me of greater significance than the mere political struggle between the two houses and the emperor which is in any case subordinate to the power wielded by the benegesserit which the reverend mothers themselves recognise is not supremehowever if you want to see parallels with contemporary issues such as the problems of living in a postimperial world they are still very visible and the romance between paul and chani is not a romance at all burdened as it is with the visions and portents of a messianic futurei should add that i am neither a fan of the books having read barely pages of the first nor as an atheist do i adhere to any religious faith i am however a believer in the power of cinema,positive
395,i saw it at a screen x cinema and it is without a doubt the greater cinematic experience i have had in my entire life splendid cinematography beautiful visual perfection from start to finishi havent read any of the books but it seems as though that is irrelevant to the experiencei was so disappointed with myself for not seeing part one in the theatres but i promised myself that i wouldnt deny myself of this wonderful experiencetimothees acting was absolutely remarkable and deserves multiple nominations but i was most impressed by zendaya i feel like she put in the best big screen performance of her career she was phenomenal from start to finish,positive
396,dune is a masterful continuation of the epic saga set in a captivating scifi universe building upon the rich lore established in its predecessor this film immerses viewers in a world of political intrigue fantastical landscapes and profound character developmentdirector denis villeneuves visionary approach brings frank herberts iconic novel to life with unparalleled brilliance from the sweeping desert vistas to the intricate details of the various factions every frame is a testament to meticulous craftsmanshipthe performances are nothing short of stellar with each actor fully embodying their respective roles timothe chalamets portrayal of paul atreides exudes both vulnerability and strength anchoring the narrative with a compelling presence supporting cast members including zendaya oscar isaac and rebecca ferguson deliver equally captivating performances adding depth to the ensemblethe visual effects are breathtaking seamlessly blending practical and cgi elements to create a visually stunning world that feels both authentic and otherworldly hans zimmers haunting score further elevates the cinematic experience imbuing each scene with an emotional resonance that lingers long after the credits rollwhat truly sets dune apart however is its thematic depth beneath the spectacle lies a poignant exploration of power destiny and the human condition as the story unfolds it poses thoughtprovoking questions about the nature of leadership the consequences of choice and the interconnectedness of all lifein conclusion dune is a triumph on every level it surpasses its predecessor in scope ambition and execution delivering a film that is as intellectually stimulating as it is visually captivating a true masterpiece of modern cinema deserving of the highest praise,positive
397,this was an enjoyable film with great sounds and superb special effectshowever despite the fact that a third film is inevitable there are many questions that should have been answered and several parts that seemed extremely underwhelmingalthough i did enjoy the film overall it was far from perfect as the end battle was a serious let down and key characters and their backgrounds were sadly left to the imagination rather than factored into the storycharacters were also built up only to be let down so easily i found that very frustrating and quite disappointingthere was so much potential and yet so many missed opportunities that i feel should have been easily seen as a problem during productionyet the were notoverall it certainly was entertaining and quiet the price of admission just not nearly as entertaining as it could have been with proper directionhopefully the third part will increase my rating but unfortunately the errors that currently exist sadly cannot be corrected noweven with adequate future clarifications,positive
398,what a stunning piece of cinema if you could create a new genre named sophisticated scifi then this would be top of the rankingsafter dune part one i was hopeful expectant but a little apprehensive as to what was coming next despite the incredible cinematography the first film was quite slow going and convoluted in setting up the premise however i neednt have worried as part two was a much simpler premise setting up the paul atreides revenge story but also gave so much action drama and moment of pure tension austin butlers psychotic portrayal of feydrautha stole the show but there were also excellent turns from chalamet zendaya and the whos who of hollywoodwhat is clear is that villeneuve does scale better than any of his peers and when the worms take front and centre in some of the biggest scenes he shows why he is a master of his art it really is a film that deserves to be on the big screen and showed once more why we should savour our cinemas before its too late,positive
399,dune felt a lot like an intro beautiful made and created with a great soundtrack to support that mood but without any changes of pace to support that buildup of epicness and suspense into something memorable and climacticthe abstraction and dialogues also prevented me from really being immersed in the movie i kept in the role of a distant observer watching some piece of art quite relaxing but not very exhilarating something i do expect from an epic telling of duneand i cant say that changed much in part yes the story continues and becomes a bit more interesting because we start to move more towards the climax of the story but the style is still the same i dont get immersed im just an observer again a beautiful and a sort of peaceful experience where even the battle scenes pass by in an muted dream stateit was only up to a half hour before the end there was finally some emotion coming out with a bit more pace thats also when i knew he does this not enough it needs to dance more with different pacings to really make it memorableso i appreciate the artfulness of the movies hes created a beautiful and interesting world but everything inside of it the people the life the story feels muted and dead like a painting,positive
400,i was sooo captivated by the first movie and after waiting for the second one for so long with extra months after all of those spoilers in press about how even cooler is to be the second part ive got this ooit was like watching a very long film trailer or a clip it was chopped into weird episodes that just dont build a narrative and have no logic to be honest im not a fan of frank herberts writing and while im amazed with the dune universe and how he managed to imagine this all his writing style is horrible sorry fans i loved the first movie specifically because it lets become really a part of this mystery and this world and feel its beauty that herbert described clumsilybut for the second part well it was painful to read the book to follow the logic in there and its hilarious to see how scenarists or maybe video editors succeeded in making it even worsemany key episodes are just vanished from the movie the tremendously important episodes or jessica and then paul taking water of life and what happened to them what they saw geez what these barbarians did to those drink something blue omg shes pregnant the end reallythe final battle of arrakeen is a minute awkward thingok im done it was too bad even the visual effects somehow were better in the first movie then here,negative
401,your review paints a vivid picture of a movie that not only entertains but also pushes the boundaries of storytelling and filmmaking the emphasis on the casting suggests that the actors truly inhabit their roles bringing depth and authenticity to the characters additionally the mention of massive character arcs indicates a rich and dynamic narrative that keeps viewers engaged from start to finish the praise for creative and unique camera angles suggests a visually stunning experience that immerses audiences in the world of the film overall your review conveys a sense of awe and admiration for a movie that sets a new standard for cinematic excellence,positive
402,ive watched many movies and that movie was the best one ive ever seen everything about it was beautiful from the cinematography the special effects the acting the story development everything was so cool you could see how the characters drastically change throughout the movie especially paul and specifically lady jessica so different by the end of the movie its a big watch but i cant recommend this enough what a way to go into with such a fantastic movie i really do think that its going to win a lot of awards i cant praise it enough for what it is its truly the best film ive seen truly a masterpiece,positive
403,i felt like i was watching cinematic history play out before my eyes absolute masterpiece i cant name a single movie that has shaken me this deeplyi felt like i wanted to be a part of the world even more than i did when i first watched avatar in the theater and if were going to compare the two the visuals and cultural depth in this movie are better the plot development is leagues ahead as is the actingthe christian parallels in particular struck me profoundly as a christian myself there were a few scenes when i actually cried not for sadness for sheer awe especially when paul truly assumes his full power tingles everywherewow im not even coherent right nowlong live cinema,positive
404,incredibly grateful to have seen this as it was released feels like i got to see star wars or lord of the rings on opening night absolutely stunningi read the books and fell in love after the first movie i was so happy that denis villeneuve did the book justice and prayed that the second would live up to it it exceeded it by far i genuinely have no complaints despite knowing what was going to happen from reading the books i was on the edge of my seat still questioning the outcome of fight scenesthe casting was spot on the music was incredible the visuals were insane and the cinematography was legendary i cant wait to see more in the next film,positive
405,this is arguably the best scifi movie of all time cant think of a span with more than minutes of downtime from start to finish you are completely immersed in a new world with mesmerizing imagery and unbelievable score and amazing dialogue dune should stay in imax for as long as possible it is a truly amazing experience and worth every penny to see in theaters if you somehow come across this review and are debating seeing dune at a movie theater or waiting for it to come to a streaming service like hbo please please go see it at your nearest imax you will not be disappointed long live lisan al gaib,positive
406,film of the year saw it twice in the cinema may see it a third amazing acting music was phenomenal and gave incredible gladiator vibes soundtrack is on repeat at home scenes that could be deemed as slow were acted so well with beautiful cinematic imagery that it flowed so well felt like an hour movie could have stayed for more without giving anything away the worm scenes are goosebump worthy throughout so many moments that could be a favourite that my husband and i talked about them for days after absolute masterpiece and i really do hope that timothee chalamet wins an oscar for this one as he really does deserve it,positive
407,this is a beautifully made mostly entertaining filmit does feel that so many movies are now being made to be watched in the cinema all sound and vision beautiful cinematography artistic set pieces lots of weird booming noises visual metaphors and if youre lucky great musicdune is no exception a rollercoaster ride of a film a popcorn flixunfortunately this all means that the story suffers becoming either bland and predictable or mysterious without making any real sensefrank herberts dune creates a complex galaxy with important story elements the significance of spice in holding the planets empire together the crucial role of the spacing guild that paul uses to defeat all of his enemies but this film seems barely aware of them so much so that it seems they cannot make a sequel worth making david lynchs attempt is like a masterpiece in comparisonhaving said that i enjoyed it far more than the first one and i did enjoy watching almost all of it great acting and special effectsa really great film to watch at the cinema once,positive
408,id already loved seeing the first part in imax but with this second opus villeneuve has completely amazed me the film is even more grandiose than the first with actors music and visuals that are as powerful as ever memorable and thrilling for over hoursblending religion politics and romance villeneuves script takes just the right amount of time between action scenes to convey the complexity of frank herberts universe i left the cinema breathless having not seen such a complete science fiction film for a very long timego to the cinema as soon as you can because the experience is uniqueand for the lucky ones go for the imax,positive
409,its something is not broken dont fix it the story was a literary masterpiece one of if not the greatest science fiction novels of all time the acting was amazing the special effects amazing the costume and environmental design were perfect but the was change so much a fictional universe such as this is so complex that when you change key things the story wont make sense paul and chains relationship was changed the time line of the story was changed main characters were not even in the movie thufir hawat count fenring alia atreides who is pauls sister who should have been born during this movie and was the character who actually killed the barron they have completely changed the story from what it should be i understand into todays climate you must cater to the most democratic its just a shame that literary and intellectual masterpiece such as this wasnt treated the way it should beoverall the movie was awesome for someone who has no knowledge of the novel it is a must watch for fans of the dune novels you may be disappointed,positive
410,every enemyopponent in this movies are incredibly bad at fightwar also these armies supposed to conqure galactic wide of areas but they have like helicopters stromtroopers and a few personal guards with swords lol the only good and passable thing about those movies are visuals but why do people overrate whenever they some some decent visuals the characters the dialogs the action and storytelling are so incredibly childish that it is unbelievable that writersdirector arent actually years old kidsthe characters are especially so bad none of them suits to what they should be maybe because whenever we see a character theres a huge db sound of whaaaaaaaoooo and for the love of god can anyone tell me whats the deal with zendeya she looks like a genz tiktok influencer none of those desert people looks like they do live there without water etc and that blue eyes look laughable on themthe world is really effed up isnt itsince oppenheimer barbie godzilla past lives poor things are on oscars lootbox live service gaming era of movies,positive
411,calling dune part a masterpiece will be underselling the movie dune part one establishes the world of dune and its characters in a befitting manner part carries all that built up tension and creates yet another magical experience that is perhaps the best adaptation of the book possibledenis villeneuve is a magician the way he brings the world to the screen is nothing short of magic each scene is a canvas each character chiseled with perfect craftsmanship each line of screenplay weaves the movie magic each action set piece deserves a standing ovationand the sound of dune is an equal compatriot of the stunning visuals that this movie has each thumping noise to the whoosing noise of spice in the air bring arrakis to lifea movie adaptation that should be watched multiple times,positive
412,i dont write reviews often and almost never use the word masterpiece i went to see this movie with my youngest son i always brag to him and others that i went to see empire strikes back in the theatre in after this movie i turned to him and said one day you will brag to your son that you went to see dune part on opening day we are witnessing the birth an epic movie saga like no other this is the reason we still go to see movies in movie theaters and i will also buy the k bluray when it is available it is difficult to praise any aspect of this film over others because it can win every category at the oscars what a film,positive
413,where to begin wow the scale of this movie surpasses everything the action the performances the music everything is perfect the film picks up where the previous one left off to create what could feel like a war behind the screen it feels so real emotions flow throughout the projection from beginning to endwe witness pauls growth to become the promised messiah and as he does the terrifying sensation caused solely by the idea of what is to come is chillingfeydrautha is terrifying in a very explicit sense he is unpredictable and sadistic truly relishing it and austin butler portrays him magnificently but the figure of paul played by timothe chalamet feels like oppression itself of a much more powerful and sinister evil truly terrifying yet his more human side is not overlooked as we see his suffering from the fate that falls upon his shoulders to not dwell too much on interpretations i must simply say that there is not a single one that disappoints they are all truly magnificenthans zimmer picks up where he left off in the part one and elevates it providing a sense of epicness without neglecting the mystique the visuals are incomparable the effects are polished to the smallest detail making you believe in dune in arrakis and in the entire world built by frank herbert and shown through denis villeneuves visionlastly regarding this it can only be said that this great director continues to improve he always surprises for the better with this film he brings his sensitivity which has already made him stand out to tell the most epic story of his career perhaps his greatest challenge and he has succeeded what seemed impossible he has achievedi truly feel fortunate to have seen this movie in theaters it was a sublime experience i hope that just like the book did in its own right this movie becomes a benchmark for propelling the future of scifi in cinema,positive
414,having read the books and being a huge fan of the first movie i walked into the cinema expecting a masterpiece i walked out feeling exactly that amazing cinematography score and stunning performances timothee chalamet zendaya and rebecca ferguson deserve oscarsthe scenes shot in ir are some of the best cinematography to exist period dune part two captures the essence of the book and elevates it to an art form that is beautiful terrifying and utterly breathtakingthere were scenes where the raw power of the film and score led me to tears this movie deserves best picture and so much morehowever i do have a few gripes firstly the relationship between paul and chani was one of calm and trust in the book here it was one of doubt and mistrust that is a bit sad to see although it does add significant tension into the relationship which may become a pivot point in the futurealso many scenes were omitted particularly for length decisions however not getting to see hawat or the decadence of house corrino and the golden line throne was a bit of a shamethat said dune part is a work of art i will be watching this film again and again it is a reminder of what can be achieved when pure passion and love is dedicated into a rich complex and beautiful source material,positive
415,the entire texture of this film is so different from the first part one with a singular storyline this story fanning out allowing space for characters to unfurl the pacing moves with these arcs sometimes slowing and at other times hastening but at all times not overdoing exposition and keeping the story moving the fact that many peripheral characters in part one are given much more screen time is wonderful i found it of special interest they paid so much to developing out the fremen culture too so it had its own identity just nothing short of magicthe movie itself is beautiful the scifi immense and strange geidi prime rendered as monochromatic horror kaitan lush and decadent everything has a visual identity the beauty of arrakis made even more dramatic by the terror of the worms and its stormspolitics is at the core of the film though and its interplay with faith belief and religion paul is given a much darker turn his messianic trajectory driving a visible fall from the grace of the fremen instead an instrument of the political long play of the true power of the bene gesserit prophecy is depicted instead as corruption of freedom another whip to control the masses i cant wait to see how this is played out in part three it has to come too much is left unresolvedthis by far is one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time and it deserves every accolade it receives,positive
416,as a film editor and creator myself i have always watched movies from a back stage point of view trying to work out how they made certain scenes what sort of editing techniques they may use to build scenes and why but never really getting lost and pulled in to the story especially with the lack of good movies lately in cinema its very rare when a movie is so good that all i can do is just let go of all my own technical observations and truly just enjoy the story with dune part two i had no choice it truly pulls you in deep the story the characters everything thats going on around you disappears and all you can think about is whats going to happen next this is how i know its a good movie i highly recommend watching this in the big screen the music is outstanding the story is extremely epic and satisfying to witness best movie i have seen in years even tho i knew this was going to be an amazing film after loving the first story i was still blown away and taken by surprise go see it now,positive
417,i was very much looking forward to this movie since i enjoyed part one also because dennis villeneuve sets a high standard for himself i started watching with high expectations but this movie is not the master piece some claim it to beothers here have written similar remarks there is somehow a lack of depth to this movie the story and the characters are rather shallow despite the buildup from part one which seemed to have much more depth the movie is even rather boring at timesthe strong point of the film is that it is visually stunning although nothing revolutionary what also struck me is that soundeffectwise this movie is very similar to other hollywood blockbusters which is a let down i expected more since the first movie had some very original sound effectsdont get me wrong its not at all a bad movie its entertaining at times but it is definitely not a classic like the empire strikes back as some people claim,positive
418,this film is an epic actionpacked scifi experience denis villeneuve goes all out in this second part of what looks to be one of the best scifi film series if not one of the best film series everthe film starts unpacking the amazing story of dune where the previous film introduced us to it is not neccesary to see part one to enjoy this film but it definetly makes the experience more complete villeneuve took everything from part but made it bigger and betterwhere the previous part was lacking on emotional level and action this one completely makes up for it in its hours and minutes runtime that feel less it is filled with more depth in the story with as main point the struggle of paul chosing between his foreseen destiny and his own loving desires while getting revenge together with the fremen for the brutal destruction of his familyto top it off this film comes with a couple of plottwists that keep you at the edge of your seat aswell as new characters portrayed by an amazing cast that give outstanding performances together with the great already known cast of dune part oneall in all this is a must watch for every film fan especially in cinemas where hans zimmer takes you straight to arrakis with his once again otherworldy amazing scoredare i say this second part of the dune film series comes close to perfection,positive
419,ive been looking forward to this movie however ive just watched it and was disappointed at how long and drawn out it was the first movie was much better we had a number of people walk out before this movie finishedi cant see how you can possibly give this movie a out of the visuals were good but it was seriously lacking in actionif you were a fan of the first movie it is worth going to see just to get closure on the story line it had a lot more potential to be entertaining but for me it just didnt deliver its a shame the world that was built in the first movie was interesting and i thought id love part but sadly didnt,positive
420,mcdune diet edition episode the hollywood dollar empire strikes back on creativity originality and intelligence playing it heavy on the safe again and not even trying anything lest god forbid you hesitate and go elsewhere did the bold peculiar imaginative and complex dune deserve to become this dune has always been out of the mainstream simply because it was weird and that was its grit but not anymore dune became cool correct and relatable got a new logo and a silver foil everything complex and controversial has been cut out everything weird toned down everything surreal turned into realistic everything absurd into ordinary and the whole thing has been averaged and run through an ai market analyzer so that todays average squeamish viewer can enjoy it effortlessly and still manage in a good mood and unburdened by thoughts to stop at hm and new yorker star trek and star wars have been milked to the scabs and the masses need a new franchise i get it when a marvel comic receives this treatment but dune and for the overcautious collectivist and standardized hollywood to embark on such an unscrupulous unapologetically noncorrect and alternative subject on the triumph of individualism is like the dprk deciding to make orwells and people arent even ashamed to claim dune as their childhood idol and doing this to it and profiting from it with no scruples a midbudget animated series that would relieve creators of market pressures and allow them to go deeper that would have dabbled in the psychedelia and eccentricity that makes dune dune and that would have paid homage to lynch jodorowsky moebius giger foss and the entire s thats what dune deserved not another boilerplate and selfabsorbed blockbuster of which there are a dozen every year and which of all the adaptations of dune including the unrealized ones have brought nothing to the table except dollars,positive
421,here is the best part about seeing dune part two in cinemait almost didnt happen it was the last day of the showing at my cinema and my sister was late i wanted to experience this in the cinema and at last i did and it was spectacular its funny how i have so many words yet no words at all to describe the feeling of watching this masterpiece denis villeneuve is one of a kind his vision transcends into this and please i am begging you to give this man all awards everits visually special for sure but the actorswell they acttimothe chalamet once again proves that he is the leader of the new acting generation he is mature and serious and we see his process of growing and changingrebecca ferguson austin butler are probably two of the biggest standouts in this film along with chalamet in every scene they are in their command i am looking forward to seeing florence in the third part because she is the forceneed to mention the score because wow hans zimmer just won his second oscar for this filmits a masterpiece,positive
422,in the realm of science fiction few sequels have managed to eclipse the grandeur and depth of their predecessors however dune part two not only meets this elusive challenge but soars beyond delivering a cinematic experience that is as colossal in its narrative ambition as it is in its visual spectacledenis villeneuves adaptation of frank herberts seminal work continues with a narrative that is both expansive and intimate weaving a tale that is as much about the vastness of the universe as it is about the intricacies of human emotion and power the film picks up seamlessly from where the first installment left off plunging the audience back into the arid yet aweinspiring landscapes of arrakisthe storys hero paul atreides timothee chalamet is now fully entrenched in the world of the fremen the indigenous people of arrakis his journey from a naive young duke to a leader hardened by the realities of interstellar politics and war is portrayed with a sensitivity that belies the epic backdrop against which his story unfolds chalamets performance is nuanced capturing the internal struggle of a man caught between destiny and desirerebecca ferguson returns as lady jessica whose strength and complexity are given even more room to shine in this sequel her portrayal of a mother and a political powerhouse is compelling adding layers to a character that could easily have been overshadowed by the grandiose setting and plotthe films antagonist house harkonnen is depicted with a grotesque opulence that is both repelling and fascinating stellan skarsgards baron harkonnen is a figure of nightmarish tyranny his presence on screen as commanding as it is chillingvilleneuves direction is masterful balancing the intimate moments of character development with breathtaking set pieces that showcase the films staggering budget and technical prowess the battle scenes are a particular highlight with the directors use of scale and perspective creating a sense of immersion that is rarely achieved in cinemathe cinematography is nothing short of revolutionary each frame is a painting a carefully crafted composition of light and shadow that brings the alien world of arrakis to life the use of color from the deep blues of the fremen eyes to the golden sands of the desert is deliberate and evocativethe score composed by hans zimmer is a character in its own right it is both haunting and heroic underscoring the films themes of legacy loss and the relentless pursuit of power the music elevates the visual storytelling creating an atmosphere that is immersive and emotionally resonantdune part two is not without its flaws the pacing while mostly deliberate occasionally falters and some may find the films adherence to the source material a hindrance to its narrative momentum however these are minor quibbles in what is otherwise a triumph of science fiction filmmakingin conclusion dune part two is a monumental achievement it is a film that demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible not just for the sheer scale of its visual ambition but for the depth of its storytelling villeneuve has crafted a sequel that not only honors herberts vision but expands upon it creating a work that is both a fitting tribute and a standalone masterpiece this is a film that deserves not just ten stars but a place among the pantheon of science fiction classics,positive
423,absolutely incredible story and one of the best sequel movies that comes close to the empire strikes back visual stunning thanks to the cinematography of grieg frasier the visual effects and sound designs were amazing and shook the theater the character dynamics between paul and chani from being star crossed lovers from different worlds slightly matches from the book but some story changes were made from the book as well however it kept with the consistency with the narrative of the first film denis villeneuve has crafted a magnum opus of a film and im hoping that he gets greenlit for dune messiah,positive
424,think back at every generation and their iconic films i was when i watched the dark knight and this dune part is my the movie of my generation everything good about this movie is what makes the dune series the most rich story in scy fi i left the movie theater after watching this movie thinking that villanue has really made something of himself a director of this caliber only comes once in a lifetime and im so glad that he has decided to take the mantle of sci fy if youre interested in the story of the june universe i highly recommend reading the box and dive in full end until this rich rich world i know we will all be waiting for dune messiah,positive
425,visual this movie is a feast for the eyes denis villeneuve managed to visualize the planet arrakis very well although thats only part of the planet but you will be surprised in some parts because the colors move very quickly cut to cut dark to lightmusic scoring well when hans zimmer is in charge theres no cure really the sound design is magnificent every time you hear the beat of the music your chest will shakestory the storytelling in each act always makes me curious and interested to see the continuation in the next acts the character development of paul muaddib atreides and his mother is very good from being a nobody the community is even skeptical to being trusted and reveredinterpretation for those of you who study eschatology understanding this movie will not be difficult especially if you learn from several religions the concepts of messiah almahdi antichrist and prophethood are all here for myself i ended up wondering again about the eschatological concept that i currently believe in maybe the promised almasih almahdi the concept can match what frank herbert wrote maybe after all frank must also have been inspired by the eschatological concepts of existing religions,positive
426,seriously find yourself a friend that believes in you and hyped you up like stilgar does to paulhaving rewatched the part just yesterday part is a step up of everything its predecessor had to offertimothee chalamet is brilliant he seriously stepped up his portrayal from a guy who just wants to fight for his people to embracing his messiah destiny is perfectzendaya is absolutely phenomenal her character is the most interesting in the whole movierebecca ferguson is masterful she becomes terrifying javier bardem is a fantastic hyphenated and austin butler as the maniacal feydrautha is amazing i just wish we could have seen more from himhans zimmer simply cant miss his score his simply amazing its brings this space epic into a whole new bigger scale than the first im no lisan algaib but i see another academy award in his futuregreig frasers visuals are fantastic this movie is gorgeous some of the images deserve their own portrait it just does the most to tell a story without anyone saying anythingvisual effects in a much bigger scale and they nailed it i already loved them in the first but i dont know how they actually outdid themselves with this onedennis villenueve has written himself in history books with this space epic this is what it should feel going into the theatre for a blockbuster love the choices he made theres this parallel i noticed and adored in the beggining of the movie when paul and his mother arrive in fremen city they are surrounded by fremen who hate thee since he killed one of their own but as he accepts he is lisan algaib hes walking through the fremen who love him and worship him it was beautifulthe hype is real go watch this movie support it we want more of this we need more of this,positive
427,after i read the book saw the other movies and dune part one i was expectin to see a good moviei was a little bit desapointed about it as it is a very slow placed movie acting is quite bad in some scene and the corrography needs to be improved for surefreemen were formidable warriors higly skilled and though i this movie they are not depicted as strong and looking at the movie again it seems that the fighting sceene are very poorly designedthe music is very nice creating a good atmosphere and there are good creathed caracthers but i think the hours movie dune is way better the main caracther is weak and poorly playd zendaya stilgar and the mother are better created charactersi was a litle bit dissapointed,positive
428,i do not say this lightly this may be the best movie i have seen in years this trilogy is shaping up to be the scifi equivalent to the lord of the rings trilogy this movie may have been perfect here are the positivesactingeditingcinematographyactionspecial effectsthe black and white sequenceit was all just so marvelous it feels like the biggest in scale movie i have ever seen it is also accurate to tue book important parts are near verbatim denis makes some changes that i feel like work for the better this movie is immense it is a masterpiece go see it in imax,positive
429,i do t get it the movie was epic and stunning to watch but it lacked plot and agencyit feels like the first thing that happened was after the first hour if i walked into the cinema after one hour i wouldnt have missed a single point of the storythere was even a great recap of the first movie in part so that i almost didnt need to have watched itwith the slow walk to the predictable point of no return the movie still managed to feel very rushed in the endat the base it was a great story but way too long why even spend so long time with side characters that doesnt impact the movie muchthis is a movie that actually could have used a montage of character development instead of the torture of time just passing by,positive
430,the first one was nearly perfect a movie was hooked from the first till the last scene but what is this the pacing the jumps in storytime the first hour of the movie is absolutely poinless and could have been done in minutes not hr gives no explanation to whats going on just pushes characters in and out of the storysituation when neededthe cgi wide shots we great harkonens were the best part but were on screen a small amountfeydrautha was absouletly the peak of the film and he is also basically meaningless and just breazes trough the movie without any significant impact the final battle carries little emotional impactafter a magnificent dune we got this subpar bore of a movie and it is absolutely scary to see just how peoples standards for good moviesart have fallen people glorify this as a masterpiece when it is far from it decades of sub par art will do that,positive
431,absolutely an amazing movie i could not believe h went by in the blink of an eye all of the actors were fitted to their roles perfectly and acted in a convcincing manner the esthetics of the movie were pleasant music captivating and special effects generous there were funny moments in the movie or maybe it was just me finding it funny i dont remember last time ive seen a movie this good absolute masterpiece after it finished i just wanted to carry on and watch it for longer and longer now i need to read books as i cannot wait for another movie part to come up which probably will be in another couple of years,positive
432,masterfully directed by denis villeneuve the first chapter of the cinematic adaptation of frank herberts masterpiece dune opens its doors to a vast and unsettling universe with meticulous attention to detail and stunning aesthetics villeneuve brings to life on the big screen the landscapes of an atypical universethe film follows the story of paul atreides portrayed by timothe chalamet a young noble who becomes the key to crucial events as his family takes control of the planet arrakis also known as dune the only place in the universe where melange is found a precious substance that affects the entire known world through its effectswith an impressive ensemble cast including rebecca ferguson as pauls mother lady jessica and oscar isaac as his father duke leto atreides the film shapes its characters in a way that allows the audience to feel a deep connection with this fascinating world additionally the performances of jason momoa as duncan idaho and dave bautista as glossu rabban add an extra dimension of intensity and dramavilleneuve uses his remarkable directing skills to build a tense atmosphere full of mystery and danger the magnificent visuals and hypnotic soundtrack contribute to creating a captivating and memorable cinematic experiencethe novel dune considered unfilmable and rightfully so is somewhat minimalist in its portrayal which might somewhat bother the purists of the book series but the general impression is that denis villeneuve has done as much as possible in this regard given the constraints imposed by a film of maximum hourswith a brisk pace and a wellconstructed narrative dune ii follows pauls rise amidst the desert tribes and his exploration of his prophetic powers as well as his confrontation with the imperial and political forces seeking to control himtimothe chalamets performance is surprising showing the complex evolution of his character as he discovers his true power and assumes his responsibilities as a leader meanwhile the supporting characters continue to shine and the remarkable acting performances of stellan skarsgrd as baron vladimir harkonnen the most successful so far add depth and emotional tensionvisually dune ii impresses with its epic battle scenes and stunning landscapes of the planet arrakis while the intense soundtrack contributes to amplifying the tense atmospheredune i and dune ii represent not only two remarkable films but also an exceptional cinematic adaptation of a monumental literary workperhaps a bit more could have been done my fundamental reproach is that villeneuve did not even explain through a reference the fundamental premise of the universe he describes namely the butlerian jihad the war against machines an event that explains why the dune universe looks the way it does why there are no ais or even computers what was the fundamental role of spice what the guild was and why it needed this substance found only on dune and so forth,positive
433,was able to watch earlier than most and i gotta say denis villeneuve is definitely a fan of the novels several scenes were long but it never felt boring or dragged out my attention was always present throughout the whole film which is impressive considering the lengthi got goosebumps multiple times but the two most memorable times was first when paul was riding the worm it was shot in a way that you as the viewer especially in the cinema with those dolby atmos speakers feel like youre riding it yourself unrealthe other time was when all the fremen was worshipping him when he truly became the muaddib waking up and being able to see both past and futureto top it all off the music and scenery is off to everyone who worked on this and my favorite composer hans zimmer going to be a blast watching him live soon,positive
434,im utterly speechless after witnessing dune part it is truly a masterpiece every aspect of this scifi work of art is beyond remarkable the worldbuilding is so meticulously crafted and the visuals and sound are simply breathtaking trust me when i say i cannot believe my eyes i was completely swept away by it all and cant wait to dive back in for another viewing please please please make sure to see it on the biggest screen with the most incredible audio setup you can find my own experience in mm dolby atmos was nothing short of a lifechanging experience its truly the pinnacle of cinematic brilliance,positive
435,best movie i have seen in over years great experience by great actors and direction i highly recommend you see this film best war scene and action taking place in a scifi universe the build up from the first movie set this movie up for great success and character development looking forward to seeing how this movie raises the bar on future films in the genre to come as i patiently wait for future films i will do my part in supporting this films success outside of extreme happiness it has brought me highly recommend seeing this in its full glory in an imax theater again thank you for work,positive
436,with the rise of streaming services and the quality of what is being put out from those platforms it is most important if you are a fan of cinema to experience this movie in the next few weeks potentially multiple times denis villeneuve has accomplished a great task of bringing dune to the big screen the second part of the adaptation has only improved on the world building and visuals from the first the story is rich and fast paced while not devolving into a convoluted and confusing mess a few standouts of the story besides the obvious timothee chalamet and zendaya were javier bardem and rebecca ferguson the movie left we wanting for more even after its almost hour runtime if you want quality films to continue being made dune part two is the film that will cement your admiration of this medium,positive
437,okay so lets just reign in this hypetrain now my rating is probably closer to an which in the way i rate movies on here is very very good but i feel i just need to help settle down this average that is being blown all out of proportion dont get me wrong this movie looks and sounds incredible but that is where the incredible ends there are many sound bites and quotes flying around which we all know are handpicked or even funded by the studio that are going to lead you to believe this is the greatest film of all timeit isnt or that austin butler has delivered us one of the greatest movie villains of all timehe hasnt these are merely part of the sales pitch unfortunately when you deal with a project such as this that already has a massive following from the books there is no middle ground the fans will destroy the movie or hail it as the greatest adaptation of all time these fans that hold the books in such high regard feel a sense of ownership as if they are trying to tell the world you see we were right you all called us nerds or geeks but now look and they will shout longer and louder until everyone else agreeslike i said this is a very good movie but it is merely the middle spoiler alert theres gonna be another one now unlike maybe the dark knight or empire strikes back i dont know if this is something you would just watch randomly a few years on from now you would have to set aside the time to make a dedicated effort to watch the whole saga which for me removes it from the great movie conversationa truly great movie should be something you can watch at the drop of a hat something you can switch on halfway through and be instantly enthralled because youve seen them so many times i just see that with this movie oppenheimer was the same a fantastic film but are you gonna stick it on when youve got a few hours to kill while you wait for your solicitor to get back to you with the news of how much of your pension your soontobe ex wife wants in the divorce settlement no youre gonna grab flight of the navigator off of the dvd shelf or city slickersi digress in a nutshell great visuals incredible sound some good performances although a missed opportunity with butlers greatest movie villain of all time pacing was a bit all over the place at times but overall a more than worthwhile next part to the story i hope the next part whether its the final part or not delivers too,positive
438,the film dune is a cinematographic work that impresses in several aspects from the gripping soundtrack to the brilliant scenes and footage the production captivates the viewer from start to finish timothe chalamets performance stands out adding a layer of depth to the characterwhen watching the movie the experience is engaging and exciting the expectations created by the critics are surpassed leaving the public eager to review the work the harmony between villeneuves vision and hans zimmers music is remarkable contributing to the immersion in the narrativein short dune is a movie that deserves to be enjoyed in theaters with impeccable performances a striking soundtrack and stunning scenes the production stands out as a true work of art now it remains to look forward to the third film and continue to marvel at all that duna has to offer,positive
439,this is actually one of the few movies where i didnt necessarily agree with the high ratings i was very excited about this sequel part was pretty great im sad i just didnt agree with what most people thought about part i enjoyed the movie overall but since i didnt read the books i was fairly confused and bored throughout the first half of the movie besides the beginning scene but i really did like the nd half though probably got more interesting after austin butlers character rolled in honestly pacing i think the pacing was weird as they couldve fleshed out the relationships training and yeah basically the story more its just not convincing compared to the first movie i didnt feel much for the characters nor did i care for them i didnt even care for chani and pauls romance and its like wow paul is already attempting to ride the worm its so dangerous and hes already succeeded on his first attempt hes that gifted there were mentions of training but really no show i mean paul was basically told to survive through the dessert as a test and learns how to sand walk better but thats it the movie simply shows the major parts but nothing much in between to build it up it was also like watching two different movies in one and now the good side is gonna ambush and fight the bad side i dont feel the movie did a good job of making me want to root for paul and the fremen i hope im explaining my gripes about this film wellmany big name actorsactresses timothee is always a good pick for these type of roles austin butlers character was cool he did a good job with the character too i like zendaya but shes not that great of an actress dave bautistas character was poorly written all he does is yell and get frustrated then kills one of their own to make them look like very bad enemies so cliche i could also barely hearunderstand some of the lines which was an irk it was especially difficult to understand stilgar because of the accent the cinematography was beautifully done though just wow i do look forward to the sequel and am interested to see what happens next at least,positive
440,its the worst movie ive watched in a long timeif someone who never saw a previous film or read a novel watches this one would not understand a thing because there is no logical explanation between some of the events like when pauls sister appeared all of a sudden and no explanation how or why the movie itsef is very slow and boringthe main actor looks like a whiney teen aristocrat instead of a strong young man even physically he doesnt look like someone who can stand a real fight or lead the whole nationin the novel paul atreides is extremely disciplined and confident in every thing he does all of his actions and words are deliberate and precisely controlled and it is this that makes him the super human being kwisatz haderaca the spice awakens his abilities but doesnt transform him into someone elsetotal waste of money and time,positive
441,for everyone wondering if they should watch this you shouldepic in all ways not a single second wasted not bored the way it continues to build its story brick by brick also enjoying a massive plot twist along the way wonderfull acting carries this well written story every in the cinema was either gasping or laughing which contributes to this being an epic movierush to the cinema to support part it left on a high note and thus it is meant to end in a high note aswel strap in and enjoylooking forward to the story beyond cuz you know the sky is the limit cheers and have fun guys,positive
442,i literally think that this is my first complex movie that i love it never gets boring perfect plot twist i just feel that i need to cry the end was so depressing but logical paul did something very unexpected and disappointing but thats what you get when you drink that blue beberage so chani did what she needed to do but still i hope he feels bad and goes back with chani and doesnt marry the other girl im sad because a bad symbolic character died which good but i wanted to see him in the next movies because he was a very good antagonist thank you for reading thispd i havent read the books,negative
443,dune part two is a masterful continuation of denis villeneuves epic adaptation of frank herberts classic novel with its sweeping visuals gripping performances and thoughtprovoking themes it cements itself as a standout achievement in modern science fiction cinemafrom the sweeping deserts of arrakis to the intricately designed sietches of the fremen every frame is imbued with a sense of otherworldly beauty and danger villeneuves meticulous attention to detail ensures that each location feels distinct and alive adding depth to an already immersive narrativefor maximum immersion in dune part two i really recommend watching detailed recap of its predecessor on youtube familiarity with the characters factions and events from the first part enriches the experience improving understanding of the sequels intricate plot and character dynamicslisan al gaib,positive
444,dune part two is quite simply a magnum opusa ben hur of our timesthe movie is so beautiful so dramatic so epic and so mesmerizing and ultimately felt so real from the start to the finish that only when it ends only then that you realise that it was just a movieperhaps the first movie which i will rate on perfection epitomisedcant wait to watch it againmust be seen in imaxgo and see an extraordinary movie and come back humbledthe sound and the visuals are extraordinary and better than anything i have ever experienceddennis villeneuve take a bowhow are you going to top thismessiah part has its work cut outmay the force be with you dennis,positive
445,the film series has something for everyone compressing the lore and technology of the dune universe into a digestible byte for most to consume it displays well the issues within hierarchal systems as well as the obligations of station foisted on others by technology group pressure and otherwise lastly the performance is one that will last in the mind it does the dune universe justice from bottom to top elegantly displaying the natural conclusions of a variety of warring ideologies in terms of maximal culturedevelopment in descent and ascent fantastic performance from all involved,positive
446,dune is a cinematic spectacle that exceeds its predecessor visually stunning with breathtaking landscapes the film masterfully blends scifi grandeur with intricate storytelling the performances especially timothe chalamet and zendaya shine adding depth to their characters director denis villeneuves vision is realized through impeccable production design and hans zimmers evocative score you can really feel that the story the first book wanted to tell is now finished while the intricate plot may be challenging for newcomers fans of the genre will revel in its complexity dune is a triumphant continuation setting the stage for an epic saga,positive
447,so after the st part i assumed they would make up for it in the nd part however the changes to the plotline are only there to facilitate a third episode because there is no closure in the nd episode and there are missing elementsi just cant forgive the total absence of the weirding way one of my favorite parts to the movie is when paul doesnt even need a weirding module which isnt in the book the glossing over of the spacing guild navigators and even their appearance is weak the fact that spice is required for interstellar travel is also ignored so that a horrible unnecessary choice is made near the end of the movie alias contributions are mostly missing as are some of pauls interactions with the bene gesserit the fight between paul and feyd is less dramaticthe big scenes are well shot and beautiful not all of the plot changes are bad i thought the more time spent on opposing factions within the fremen was good and more realisticbottom line in spite of the few improvements i felt there was less drama and many lapses i like the film better,positive
448,first a few words on the imax presentation i saw in geneva switzerland balexert cinmas certainly spectacular but the dolby atmos presentation is pretty earth shattering and ear shattering in the action sequences wear concert earplugs or be prepared to cover your ears for part of the film since permanent hearing damage is a risk if volume levels are like those in the presentation i sawas for the film bottom line the day after watching dune part two i wanted to watch it again i recently rewatched dune part one on my home system inch oled tv and dolby atmos soundbar i picked up significant character and plot detail that id missed on my initial viewing i expect i will have the same experience with dune part two there is a lot in this film but even at hours minutes a few things that were missingthe visuals are amazing no cgi artifacts i could see in contrast to an imax kong v godzilla trailer that ran just before the film incredible worldbuilding as in part one everything appears very natural even when the settings are strange otherworldlythis is a film without a dull moment every scene is critical to the storys forward movement that movement is relentless for me that was a problem not everything was explained to my satisfaction these werent exactly plot holes but rather plot ellipsesi hope villeneuve produces a longer at least h directors cut that gives the film a bit more room to breathe and the characters a bit more depthstill the actors inhabit their characters completely the story is riveting there is plenty of dramatic tension even though you know how the film will end if you are even vaguely familiar with the source materialvilleneuve hasnt produced his masterpiece yet im looking for a bit more depth and complexity i understand that dune messiah which hasnt yet been approved by warner but which looks a certainty will provide that villeneuve his actors and audience will get a chance to really unpack and dismantle the messiah myth in any case in dune parts one and two villeneuve and cast have planted the seeds for what could be scifis top film trilogy of all time,positive
449,i wanted to love this movie as much as the first but felt it lacking in some areasthe positives the cinematography and editing are superb the music almost as good as part one the sound and visual effects are stunning and villeneuve has again proven himself to be a top notch director this must be watched on the big screen for surethe mixed the acting varies in quality with performances ranging from excellent bardem chalamet ferguson butler average zendaya skarsgard to forgettable walken bautista the pacing is also a bit hit and miss with some partsscenes feeling rushed the ending pauls transformation into lisan algaibthe bad why oh why did they completely ruin the relationship between paul and chani its a key part in the book she supports him in his decision to marry irulan and his rise to power is it because she must be seen as a strong and independent womanthe harkonnens have become cliched comic book villains far from the intelligent sinister and calculating antagonists of the first movie virtually nothing is seen of the emperor and irulan they may as well not be in itthe timeline is crammed into about months rather than almost years meaning that alia isnt born yet so paul not she kills the baron why as a two year old she plays a key and powerful role in the bookafter reading some of the reviews im guessing that many have needed a quality movie like this after the dross of recent years and might be getting a bit carried away in their enthusiasm,positive
450,absolutely no movement and completely boring yawnfest whats happend to movies of late nothing exciting happening and zero excitement or suspense actors are nd rate and not memorable what happend to real movies like die hard and mad max or even naked gun or white chicks the current state of cinema and movies is pretty bleak as everything seems to feel the need to include a political or current message about society i think the last movie that actually had some backbone was three billboards outside ebbing missouri that had all the right elements and took on some topics such as revenge and religion,negative
451,by far the best filmmaking world building character development i have ever seen in cinema it brings forth everyday social issues complex psychological questions spiritual tension all into one the sound action captures you into a world that seems very much like ours but with the twist of a galactic empire each character is created to bring their own sense of theatrical value the cinematography is brilliant does not feel like cgi whatsoever almost felt too real at times im captured dumbfounded deep in thought absolutely mesmerized by this franchise this film really blew my mind i will be rewatching it again go see it asap now this is real cinemamaybe the best movie ever made,positive
452,i watched dune part two last night in my local imax theater and when the credits rolled i was simply left speechless i didnt wanna leave this universethe first dune movie changed the way i look at movies i along with everyone else were counting the days until we could finally sit down and take in this new chapterit did not disappointdune part two is a spiritual experience an absolute spectacle which kept my heart beating out of my chest for most of itevery single aspect of this movie deserves a lot of praise from the astonishing visuals to the earthshattering score but if i have to focus on one thing i would say the performances everyone brought everything they had to this movie this was a labor of love zendaya was incredible balancing out the strength of chani with the fragility of falling in love with this outsider paul and chanis love was earned throughout the movie subtlytimothe wasphenomenal larger than life oscar worthy performance the authority the intensity he rose up to the momenta once in a lifetime cinematic experience tremendous monumental,positive
453,dune part is an incredibly satisfying followup to the far less exciting and interesting part while i was not blown away by part i would say it is a necessary prerequisite to enjoying part is this movie so good that its worth watching a second lesser film in order to enjoy it yes unequivocallywhile a lot of people are talking up austin butlers performance and believe me it is awesome i really feel the shining star of the movie is timothy chalamet without giving too much away he has to play almost versions of the same character in this movie and he frankly hits it out of the park in scenes i was expecting hed be challenged by rebecca ferguson is also spectacular her character undergoes a significant change as well suffice to say both paul and his mom jessica embrace some darker impulses in this onevisually the movie is very impressive one sequence that takes place off of arrakis is particularly impressive in the way it is stylized the sandworms are featured prominently and look great one scene in particular involving a sandworm was shot practically and the realistic look of the scene really contributes to it as a highlight of the filmthematically dune is about the toxicity of revenge turning good people bad and the risk of blind faith turning humble folk into dangerous zealots,positive
454,im not even gonna write this review properly this film was perhaps one of the best films ive ever seen in theaters i feel it is our generations star wars empire strikes back from the cinematography to music to acting pacing and story this film exceeded my expectations i will say when i was told to see this film i tried to withhold any anticipation for greatness despite being told it was fantastic but i still held it when i went into the theater and i left feeling shocked on how magnificent the film was you can truly feel the magnitude of power that this film has i recommend everyone wanting this filmand i need to read the book im very invested in the structure of the bene gesserit and the underlying themes of using religion as props for colonization and war,positive
455,wow i dont think ive ever felt like that leaving a cinema viewing i heard all the reviews about this film and how good it was meant to be but i just couldnt imagine how it could be that good after watching the first film which i thought was good but nothing outstandingthis film was working on all levels at the highest standard cinematography sound design music story costumes acting and sets all of it was just incredible and very well executedi will definitely be seeing this film again at the cinema i recommend anyone seeing this for the first time to go to the best cinema they can showcase or imax somewhere they have a large screen and great sound,positive
456,this movie is an absolute gem unquestionably worth every penny of the ticket price from start to finish it delivers a truly immersive cinematic experience that will leave you in awe every aspect of this film from the acting to the cinematography to the storyline is crafted with meticulous detail and expertisewhat a movie what a movie is a sentiment that perfectly encapsulates the sheer brilliance of this cinematic masterpiece its a rare find in todays film landscape where true excellence can sometimes be elusive from the captivating performances of the cast to the breathtaking visuals that transport you to another world this movie exceeds all expectations,positive
457,like part no complaints can be made about design or imagination unlike part the entire cast are off their gamechalamet works to either keep a perfectly flat instagramaffect or is barking in a comical batman voice zendaya maintains a single expression throughout the entire film of angerhurtdistrust any chemistry between the two of them in part is gone entirely herepugh barely has any lines but reads the ones she has like shes in a police lineup pretty much everything hangs on bardem who is the emotional rock the film rests on not because thats his role in the story but because hes the only seemingly real person herethe emperors role is to be weak not to overshadow the baron as such walken is totally restrained and functions as more of a look than anything elseits gorgeous its true to the books some of the sequences are fantastic i just felt completely detached from it at all times,positive
458,from acting to cinematography art direction to costumes to sound and music this film is an absolute masterpiece the love story and action sequences are perfectly balanced and paced every frame is a stand alone art piece an incredible love letter to the greatest scifi story ever written all i can say is thank you to dennis and his team and cast for this wonderful addition to our culture it will stand the test of time and be a forever classic up there with other epics like twin towers empire and dark knight the book that defined the genre has waited over half a century for this well deserved adaptation best film of our generation full stop,positive
459,man cool to look at but not much going on underneath maybe should have been epic tv series like game of thrones they left so much out a lot if good stuff i know most people havent read the books but this was really the cliff notes version i liked the first half but the overall pacing was way off the last minutes things happened so fast it was like blam blam blam then its over wheres the kid witch wheres the weirding way wheres the guild somehow they made it seem small walken was a pretty non threatening emperor almost like an snl skit sigh another unwilling messiah story i half expected danaerys to show up on her dragon i dunno guess i am just getting old and jaded and all this tech but still fighting with swords the shielding tech isnt really explained so the swords seem dumb i didnt feel much romance from the leads its not explained whats bad about drinking the blue stuff while pregnant and the music wasnt great either during romantic scenes it sounded like cheesy s sci fi jazz ha and the final knife fight was pretty lame and hard to tell what was happening couldnt they get the the john wick fight choreographers it was fine but underwhelming overall feels like i have seen all this so many time before it is also easy to overlay a lot of parts from the last jedi which everyone hated i think maybe the heros journey has been completely wrung dry unfortunately,positive
460,i actually enjoyed part i more than this one hour in i had to check the time theres only so much time that can be spent on explaining that charlamee is the saviorthe bright spot was definitely javier bardem great performance for an otherwise banal cast of actors dont get me wrong the visuals were outstanding and the story had its moments but overall it was frankly boringthis was a big disappointment because it got off to a really good start and in the first hour the editing and immersion was on point but once they entered austin butlers character it fell apartcringeworthy character development and cliched storytelling at its finest but im sure younger people and newbie scifi fans will love it this is no masterpiece not even close part i was actually better overall,positive
461,in a word wowwhat an amazing movieto think that this completed just the first book and there are five others to go i don my hat to denis villaneuve who deserves an oscar and all the supporting costume production cinematography visual effects and anyone else i may have missedand of course the cast im still a fan of the version but at long last years after multiple attemps to buy rights and invest we finally got a movie house to take the risk i can safely say that id love to see the remaing books come to the big screen a message for denis villaneuve forget any other projects and finish the dune one,positive
462,best fiction movie ever by farall the characters special effects storyline the emotions music and sounds are just amazing the team has outperformed any high expectation if you have a chance watch videos explaining the major houses characters and story line it can help to make the experience even better it is hard to leave a movie and think it is flawless but that is what dune did the battles scenes creates real photograf effects how they edit the main oarts of the book and put it together also awesome job cant wait for the next one some people can understand the dark side of human beings the psychology love fear and power dune is one of a kind dostoevsky of ficction book,positive
463,people far more elloquent than me have already explained why this movie is so goodall i will say is that i can count on one hand the number of times ive left a cinema feeling like i was part of an experience i cant remember the last time i experienced so many spinetingling moments from truly astounding scenery and cinematography harrowing depth and gravitas immersive action sequences and epic fremen dialogueafter so many years of being lectured by hollywood with poor scripts and miscast actors dune is a welcome reminder that all is not lost hopefully film studios take note and realise what happens when you trust a director and his team to understand source material and do their best to accurately put it on the big screen although i will say that it wasnt accuratein summary amazing movie go watch it,positive
464,i had been eagerly waiting in anticipation for this movie and was not disappointed it is visually and sonically stunning and has a great pace the fact that both fremen and harkonnen spoken language were used for dialogue increased the immersionssome fans of the book who will have a more fundamentalist approach to the source material might struggle a bit with a few deviations while i perfectly understand the changes to make sure it is became a story that was capable to be captured on film i definitely struggled on a few partsit does however honor the source and its an amazing ride to experience so try to not constantly link events and timings to the book and just sit back and have an amazing take on dune unfold before you,positive
465,there is no word in the dictionary that can define the greatness of this moviebut here is something to meet the minimum character limitdune is an immersive masterpiece that seamlessly weaves together intricate storytelling breathtaking visuals and an epic musical score the films stellar cast delivers exceptional performances bringing frank herberts iconic characters to life with depth and authenticity director denis villeneuves vision is nothing short of aweinspiring as he navigates the vast landscapes of arrakis with precision and brilliance the films stunning cinematography coupled with seamless cgi creates a world that feels both fantastical and tangible dune not only lives up to its predecessor but surpasses expectations setting a new standard for epic science fiction cinema,positive
466,that sums it up for me i have not seen a movie yet that did an original book justice let alone surpass my imagination the creators of theses two movies did just that they visually and sonically expressed the story better than my mind could while reading iti understand you cannot put the complete story and world building in just hours but but even so the essence remaines and keeps the story goingdune elevates the art of booktofilm adaptations a rare feat in capturing the essence of frank herberts intricate universe the meticulous craftsmanship extends to the characters portrayed with depth and nuance the cinematography is breathtaking capturing the desolate beauty of arrakis and the grandeur of its political intrigues hans zimmers score intensifies the emotional resonance creating an immersive experience performances especially from the stellar cast bring authenticity to iconic charactersi walked out of the cinema buzzing and wowed minutes ago still am that only happened twice before i guess its in my top three,positive
467,dune part two is on par with the first in nearly every aspect however you felt about the first one is likely how you will feel about this sequel its a visual and auditory explosion of beauty and the technical aspects are all pristine directing cinematography and music are elite and they continue to build the cast with great new additionsbut just like with part one the lack of story progression is noticeable we dont get the ups and downs of a threeact structure it feels like one act stretched out to minutes again we dont seem to really have a climax i didnt feel the emotional resonance or investment in the story and characters and i didnt entirely grasp character motivations like why a character does something or why another is upset about itwith part one i was a lot more forgiving of it not being able to completely stand on its own but now its getting a little frustrating also the pg limitations are glaring viewing early fan screening imax,positive
468,a very complex story told well in two parts the focus is on the story and the characters not video game explosions or political agenda i am so stunned by how refreshing this movie is i really cant find any serious criticism i smell a sequel here and can hardly wait yes there are computer graphics but unlike most movies of recent years they are there to tell the story what a concept story telling is thousands of years old hollywood has forgotten what their job is the story is the message and its told to entertain the paying audience i couldnt detect a single dei character inserted randomly ten stars well done,negative
469,if youre looking for a film thats made of brilliance that requires persistence and some resilience thats often quite obscure and has periods of chore but is generally engaging and punctilious packed with stars from round the world the cast is great although old walken may just get you vexed and grate as will the nonsense words recited florence pugh dont look delighted and stellan skarsgrd must have loved to post deflate although the worms are truly fantastic creations if youve had them as a child theyd recall sensations but these are really big and would cause more than a jig all in all it failed to meet my expectations,positive
470,it was that bad that my husband has a headache after min i remembered why i did not like part during movie had enought time to remember avengers consider going homevisuals and sound amazing no plot total nonsence nothing is clear how when where they are going total mistery how they over took the spice palace in the end totaly randomloved the warms and that little mouse in the begining dalso having a great time reading other peoples reviews of this moviemy review is basicly it but need to reach caracters d considering to rewatch avengers d cheers d,positive
471,epic filmmaking cinematography at its best its been a while since i ve seen a really good movie attention to details character development great casting great photography and absolutely perfect soundtrack hans zimmer i dont know how you do it but you ve done it once again also the sound effects are so masterfully made that take your breath i had missed this kind of movie i love the atmosphere this director makes at his films it has a slow captivating aroma as if you almost taste the spice itself the only negative about this movie is that we have to wait now for at least four years for the next one,positive
472,went to see dune part about times will do the same with part the acting is spot on and the whole story invites you to want to discover more and more about this whole new universe and environments part did live up to the expectations in my opinion the questions ive had after seeing part were answered and part has made me curious about seeing more sad to say i have not read any books just yet so im excited to learn about the other houses planets and unfolding of the story it was a long sit but well worth the while now lets hope for a quick part arrival i cant wait to see more of dune,positive
473,a cinematic classic to the generations just watched it in imax and i am still trying to gather my bearingsacting cinematography visual effects music everything is perfect way better than the part one and exceeded my expectations by a huge marginall the movies in the year will have to play catch up to this level in my opinionthis is what we need from hollywood great storytellingif you watch this this in a cinema and you are not satisfied i dont think movies are meant for you thinking about some of the scenes alone makes me have goosebumpsdefinitely go and watch again for a second time,positive
474,not only is dune part two one of the best scifi movies of all time but it is also set to go down as one of the greatest motion pictures ever made it brilliantly excels in and exceeds all of the aspects that made the first film so good and truly represents modern filmmaking at its bestthe direction and screenplay are exceptional denis villeneuve has done an incredible job adapting a book that many thought was impossible to filmthe score cinematography action sequences and visual effects establish the grand scale of this mesmerizing motion picture everything practically screams academy awards and the star cast is topnotch timothe chalamet gives a formidable leading performance austin butler portrays a compelling antagonist and the rest of the cast is impressive but the standout for me definitely was rebecca ferguson as jessica who i hope receives a best supporting actress nomination at the upcoming oscarsi absolutely cant wait for dune messiahp s dont miss the chance to see it in imax it offers an exhilarating experience,positive
475,you wont regret if you watch dunepart two usually i dont write reviews but its impossible to not say how amazing this film is even if you are not scifi fan you should watch this masterpiecethe huge effort of the director the whole team who invented the decors and costumes and the amazing work of the actors are making this film unforgettablei think the second part is even better than the first one and for this contributes mostly austin butler also the music written by hans zimmer makes the audience feel deep emotions its unique i continue to listen the song after watching the moviedefinitely one my favourite films,positive
476,my imagination has come to life on the screen i didnt think it was possible the books were profound and intricate the film just about did it justice with the caveat that it didnt have time to go into detail about the effect of the water of life on pauls unborn sister alia this has obviously left the door open for another film riding the worms was something you could only dream about and there it was right before my eyes fabulous and euphoric the characters are perfectly imagined and portrayed the tension in the screenplay was palpable so much so i couldnt speak for a while when the film ended film that word hardly expresses the experience it was reality it surrounded and enveloped you plunging you into the world of arrakis the lasting impression was not that i had been in a fictional world but i had visited another planet and seen that good and evil is universal,positive
477,dune part two is the sequel to the sci fi movie dune by denis villeneuve based on the book of the same titleas an adaption the movie does a good job delivering the story it follows the book closely though there were some differences that will probably be addressed in the third moviethe action scenes moreover were spot on with impressive shots the movie also doesnt overdo it with its fighting scenes having them evenly spread throughout the movie and just long enough to not tire the viewer who would have to sit for a nearly three hour long filmthe performances were in addition great by everyone in the all start casthowever there were some things that were lacking first of all the romance wasnt convincing with an odd pacing and lack of chemistry between the leadsalso there way the unborn sister was presented was tiring after a whilein addition the movie seemed to lean more into the cinematography and impressing the audience then focusing on the storytelling hence for someone who hasnt read the book the movie will leave them with a lot of plotholes and with one dimentional charactersso overall seven out of ten because it was visually pleasing but not mesmerizing,positive
478,souheila yacoub truly stood out to me in this movie for some reason though her role wasnt extensive whenever she shared the screen with zendaya she captured my attention effortlessly the power emanating from her face her eyes her grin was undeniable her transformation from unbeliever to believer was portrayed with such depth i couldnt help but shed a tear when her character passed away in the moviei was personally happy after having a barren desert of senseless movies to finally have something to look forward to but i must admit that after rereading the books the timeline has changed a lot this is not a true adaptation of those books be aware of thatdune messiah will show whether or not he will be faithful to the books or whether he will change the story completelythere are problems christopher walken is really miscast as the emperor the emperor is not weak he is a politically savage animal chani is a strong female she accepts paul is stronger female and males are not equal she accepts their culture is a culture of need and not wants she is not even mad when paul takes the daughters handthis is only political not emotiona you will have my name and nothing else stilgar is not a religious zealot there is no change between the northren fremen and the southern ones yes there are more zealous ones paul inherits janiss wife and spouse,positive
479,i wasnt a huge fan of the first part as a big fan of the books i thought that they didnt really do enough to build the lore or develop the characters i thought they concentrated on the wrong elements of the booki was willing to give the nd part a fair chance to correct that get things back on track its supposed to be an adaptation and part of me does expect the general spirit of the characters to be maintained even if some of the detail wasntbook fans may be disappointed the writer and director take liberties with the source material fundamentally changing the nature of a main character if jars as a book fan to see how they treated chani not only that but it also makes further dune movies likely to deviate even further from the sourcespoilersit was a common complaint that chani waslittle used in the first part of the adaptation zendaya appeared fleetingly and had almost no significant input into things clearly thats not the case in part but her part in the story is significantly different from the original sourcein part chani seems to switch between loving paul to telling anybody wholl listen that hes not the messiah and is instead somewhat of a naughty boy it makes the intimate romantic stuff seem out of place against her continued effort to undermine the prophecy that hes the voice from another world wholl lead the fremen to freedom the sides to chani really do jar against each other the romance never feels particularly genuine when she seems to switch from lover to critic in the space of a few minutes of run timeshould that matter for the movie it possibly doesnt other than being annoying but this is the girl whos supposed to be the mother of children to paul so to have her storm out of the scene with princess irulan and to then end the film with the spurned lover calling a worm to ride alone into the desert has a far bigger negative impact book readers know what chanis role should be we know what she does in dune messiah and how things play out in children if there is going to be an adaptation of the nd and maybe even rd books in herberts series then dune part hasnt exactly made it easy to get things back on track paul is going to have to do some pretty incredible making up if hes going to convince the rather detached chani to be the mother of his kids in time for a potential messiah adaptationits not all bad the cinematography is great the sound is fantastic the scene with paul addressing the council of naibs is genuinely incredible his snarling performance in front of his doubters almost inviting them to challenge him before destroying any of their doubts with his deeply personal knowledge of their history and their ways is one of the finest scenes in recent cinema chalamet plays the scene perfectly sadly the rest of the movie cant quite reach that high point the final battlle for arakeen feels a good few minutes shorter than it should be the harkonen character design never feels particularly well done and beast raban is more pantomime villain than the guy sent to brutalise the arakis populationdoes any of that matter if id never read the original source material then it probably wouldnt id be a little bit unsure of the character development but id probably feel that most of the constituent parts of an epic scifi classic were there its a flawed movie but those flaws probably wouldnt be such an issue as they are for me as a fan of the booksultimately the director and writer have told their version of the dune novel over movies its just that the character changes not only fail to help the movie but they flat out detract from it and it ends up feeling like a wasted opportunity it could have been better and it could have set the foundation for a generational series of films,positive
480,its remarkable how much praise this film has received the novels are complex political emotional and captivating the first villaneuve film of was very slow and sullen but had a certain elegance at times if one could sit through it i had to pause every fifteen minutes in part two however the plot has been altered in unnecessary and absurd ways and drama complexity and interest have been drained sacrificed to three hours of cgi and cardboard acting the good cast sound like theyre sightreading their lines villaneuve has been quoted as saying that he doesnt like rehearsing actors but if one expects a thematically driven story like this to emerge im afraid its the people not the effects that are critical timothee chalamets monotone rhythmfree deliveryhis only style is no helpits extremely ironic that david lynchs dune was so roundly panned and to be fair it is not good while this chaotic gray interminable yawnfest has received almost universal accolades at least the lynch film had quirkiness and character frank herbert author of the dune novels is reported to have liked the lynch film i hardly think he would have approved of this sluggish travesty,positive
481,a modern masterpiece filled with incredible visuals characters and sound saw it at a fan first premiere and was blown away by just how good the movie looked and sounded if you love scifi and action this movie will more than likely be an instant classic to you very curious to see how they adapt messiah but if the first two are any indications this trilogy could go down as one of the best of all timehas really strong performances as well i loved bardem stilgar he brought a lot of humor to the movie and even had the audience laughing at multiple points throughout the film the entire cast and crew did amazing but chalamet zendaya bardem butler and yacoub were the highlights for me chalamet during the last hour of the film was literal perfection it will definitely be one of my favorite films in recent years,positive
482,the first movie was incredible this installment was epic one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life thanks to a great director and the actors it is a work of art we look forward to dune the soundtrack is incredible we must support this incredible sequel that has not given an incredible story that will be unforgettable it is also a film that does not completely involve the actors which keeps us in front of the screen super interesting excellent acting excellent cast i loved the drama lets continue supporting this type of movie which is fabulous and does not have any type of waste from beginning to end it is epic lets go for more movies like this which marked this year and deserves many awards,positive
483,the movie is straight up one of the best ever madeduring the entire time i was shivering feeling goosebumps and in the edge of my seati already enjoyed the first movie giving it a nice or but the part two is one of those rare cases where the second film is actually better than the first and in my opinion by a mile because this is just a goated film and one of my favorites too its in my top easilyacting was really really good almost flawlessthe cgi was goated really good effects and the explosions were breathtakingthe songssoundtracks were insane another hans zimmer classicplot from what i understand is difference from the books but in a the movie point of view is perfect nonetheless,positive
484,the best film of so far it surpassed its predecessor in many aspects especially in pacing visual effects and action the cast is even grander than its predecessor talents such as austin butler florence pugh christopher walker lea seydoux and anya taylor joy were significant additions to make the narrative even more powerful it is impossible not to comment on the action scenes as in the first film there were few and not many were well directed here denis villeneuve corrects this small flaw and delivers breathtaking action scenes especially the largescale war holy war of the third act of the film which can easily be compared with the epic battles of the lord of the rings franchise in short another masterpiece from master villeneuve bring on messiahs of dune,positive
485,this was definitely the best movie of this deserves all the lovethe costumes are well designed and the effects used for the film made it look real the action brought the hype and the writing and storyline definitely makes this film peak cinematimothee chalamet does a great performance in the film as paul atreides zendaya does a great performance as chani in the film as wellwell done denis villeneuve you really made this peak cinemahollywood needs this film this needs to be in famecant wait for dune messiahoverall rating metascore did i enjoy this movie yes,positive
486,i see some people recommending to watch it on the largest screen possible i agree with them and thats why i decided to go to the leonberg imax cinema in germany the largest imax screen worldwide on top of that one of the vfx supervisors gerd nefzer was there as a special guest it was an experience i will never forget the whole theater was shaking during action scenes with intense sound and of course the movie itself is a masterpiece its also significantly better than the first movie dune part is solid proof that good cinema exists and can continue to exist if the studio executives can give artists a break and allow the creative freedom necessary for such a result,positive
487,is it a good movie yes is it one of the greatest films ever nowhere nearfor almost hours i was waiting for that one of the greatest movie oat part but it never came everything feels rushedlike we didnt see half of the things that really happened and the story that they showed us in this hours colud be told in way less time there were so much unnecessary dialogues and scenes and on top of that it feels like they could add soo much more things that happened to replace those unnecessary scenes his final test to become their leader or whatever was to catch and ride a worm and they showed us how hard it was for him to catch it but then by the end of the movie we see dozens of people riding it like its nothing and on top of thatone of those people is pregnant women when it comes to dialoguesjust play the scene on and see for yourselfs in one shot he is shouting then in next shot he is turned in whole opposite direction and calmly saying protect my mother that plot twist where he finds out who his grandfather is has been seen dozens of timessoo overused so i find it very uninteresting and then endingdamn i expected so much morehe just came there finished his grandfather so easily and then that few minutes fight and thats itnothing greatest of all timein there except visuals it feels like tv show would be much better option then movie,positive
488,not even being a frank herbert fan i thought this was one of the best films ive ever seen and the story is so incredible i was blown away by every aspect of this film the sheer scale of the world they live in is incredibly well displayed on the screen in both part every actor and actress absolutely killed it with their performance and it kind of felt like part was blowing up a giant bubble and part two was when the bubble popped i mean everything comes together so nicely in the second part and denis villenueve clearly had a passion for this movie and it shows i will definitely be seeing this in theatres again probably the best movie ive ever seen,positive
489,undoubtedly this is a beautiful movie the costumes the props eg the spice gatherers and carriers the variety imaginative designs of ships some of the desert scenes and a sense of foreboding prevails throughout as it should there may be nominations for it the music is better and less grating than the first movie the bits they get right always the ones that are true to herberts book are really good but when the obviously struggling scriptwriters depart from that something even nonreaders can detect it becomes unintelligible and a problem for upcoming plot arcs more on that later there is a lot of mumbling a bit of a modern issue a good actor effortlessly enunciates to avoid this florence pugh is a bit wooden and her role is wasted rather than laborious and clumsy explanation between characters in the book irulan gives a lot of background as she is the key historic journal among others and thats a great device of herberts in this one they change alias arc make stilgar into some brainless zealot miss other key characters and chanis role is a major change issue the relationship between her and paul and his visions of her is a key plot mover throughout yet theyve changed her into some metooracial correction statement that will be very problematic particularly for the next part it may be the scriptwriters didnt read far enough ahead i watched this with my partner and he found it increasingly puzzling it was embarrassing weirdly there was a lot of emphasis on fundamentalism which others and i found uncomfortable the inevitability of pauls choices was not clear and made him seem petty and vengeful i think the main issue above all was the lack of relationship establishment it may have been script issues actor choice or performance direction im not sure herbert provides some great quotes which they missed out completely and you feel the lack of them it leaves a hollow where there could be more substance in fairness this was a huge undertaking and visually its stunning but the relationships that make you care about the characters was a misfire throughout i would watch it again with some fast forwarding i suspect but it could have been a brilliant classic rather than the puzzling and mixed bag it actually was dune remains a difficult book to translate to film sadly,positive
490,i finished watching this movie and i didnt even know what was actually happening most of the time and then i started not even caring about what was happening i like the scifi genre but this movie was all over the place it was a slow boring build up about this chosen one being part of a prophecy leading some tribes into a big battle however despite the long drawn out build up the battle itself was over quite quickly i thought dune part was good and i was looking forward to part but i was honestly disappointed and got bored quickly visually it looks great no complaints there but the story was just a bit dull and flat in my opinion i believe this is part of a trilogy and im genuinely not even bothered about watching the rd installment because i imagine it will be as long and boring as this one,negative
491,went into this with big expectations and was still blown away the greatest cinematic experience ive had in my lifetime if you havent seen this do yourself a favour and see it in the biggest screen near you denis ability to give his films scale was taken to a whole new level in this epic the weight of the movie is felt in full force with an incredible rumbling score throughout masterful editing incredible plot makes this a contender for top movies of all time this is what hollywood needs saw this movie hours ago and im still completely blown away adrenaline for days,positive

494,dune part two is the sequel to the very successful dune adaptation the story picks up right where we left off in the first film paul atreides timothe chalamet and lady jessica rebecca ferguson unite with the fremen in their quest to avenge their betrayed family paul must prove himself as the so called messiah the lisan al gaib to unite the different fremen colonies and overthrow the emperor out of power he alongside chani zendaya a fierce warrior and ambitious love interest will be tested by the brutality of the desert and even more brutal harkonnensill start by saying this surpasses the first film the depth and weight of the events that are carried out in this sequel are even more intriguing than the first the first act mainly gives time for paul and chanis relationship development it follows pauls trials to becoming fremen with a particular scene in mind that i wont spoil for you but it involves a sand worm and is one if not my favorite sequence of the entire film you are also introduced to new characters like the emperor played by the legendary christopher walken and princess irulan played by florence pugh who both are excellent in the film this is only the first actthe dune films are brought to life by an ensemble of actors who truly give it their all and portray their characters beautifully two performances that stood out for me were javier bardem and austin butlers stilgar and feydrautha props to javier for including here some awesome comedic timing his subtle nuances give out these wonderful moments for a good laugh and it works for me so well because it is unexpected on the other hand austin gives this demonic portrayal which gave me a whole new prospective on his cepabilities as an actor terrifying but amazingeach character is further explored and given time to shine if the first film was more about acknowledging the lore of the dune universe to the viewers this film is more about our characters development and arcsthe score of this film somehow got even better than the first one so much emotion and love was given here furthermore i recently found out the cinematographer who worked on both dune films is the same one who worked on films which i love like the batman and the creator greig frasers capture of shots in dune part two will blow your mind oscar worthy the shots that stand out for me are the wide shots they are glorious with the mixture of a superb soundtrack by the brilliant hans zimmer the angelic beauty of greig frasers shots and of course the direction of denis villeneuve you are left with a masterpiecethis film is truly a triumph of cinema in all honesty i would love for them to make a third film and conclude this into a trilogy but i am also good with them leaving it the way it is i am fulfilled by the ending and entertained to my core what an experience wow,positive
495,from the moment the lights dimmed in the imax theater it was clear that dune part was going to be an unforgettable cinematic journey directed by denis villeneuve this sequel not only continues the epic tale of paul atreides and his destiny among the sands of arrakis but elevates the saga to new heights both literally and metaphorically thanks to the immersive imax experiencepicking up where the first part left off dune part delves deeper into the complex politics culture and the looming war on arrakis the narrative expands on the themes of destiny power and survival challenging characters and audiences alike to ponder the costs of leadership and the sacrifices for peace villeneuve masterfully balances the dense lore of frank herberts universe with emotionally charged storytelling making the intricate plot accessible and deeply engaging,positive
496,just saw this in imax wow what a well done movie a terrific rendition of the second half of the book dunein many ways the movie is an improvement on the book making chanis character a more realistic version of the tough fighter that she was instead of the pliable obedient s era woman in the book none of that history will remember us as wives endingthe progression of pauls gradual acceptance of the mantle of the lisan algaib is also fleshed out betteraustin butler stands out in his role as the psychotic feyd rautha the portrayal of the world of giedi prime in black and white was terrificthe sandworms and the sand trout and their connection to the water of life were all well donesome have criticized stilgars transformation from a tough tribal leader into a true believer but that was his character arc in the book javier bardem showed this progression wellthe great houses refusing to accept pauls rule at the end thus triggering a devastating holy war was another logical change from the book i had always wondered why the jihad in the book still started when the great houses had accepted paul as emperor alreadya great movie destined to be remembered as one of the best scifi movies of all time,positive
497,a friend warned me that what they did to chani in pt will make me angry and boy was they rightwhy why why the need to butcher this great character so much would be too politically incorrect if she kept supporting paul be his safe haven amids the fremen blind devotion and future great houses scheming why made her this i dont even know what by the end and why the last shot of the movie is zendayas constipated face which she sported during most of pi actually liked pt better than pt though visually just as stunning less time was wasted on random slomo shots but thay ending totally ruined it for me i have no idea how they plan to transision to the next part wihout adding unnecessary paul chases after chani because she must get pregnant at some point partwhy,positive
498,i just came out of the cinema and im absolutely blown away dune part two is a masterpiece that deserves nothing less than a star rating its the best movie ive ever seen the way denis villeneuve has expanded the grandeur of the first film is nothing short of miraculous the visuals are breathtaking and the story is richly layered making it a saga that you feel deep in your bonestimothe chalamet as paul atreides is phenomenal he brings such depth to his character portraying the complex emotions of a young leader caught in a web of love duty and destiny zendayas portrayal of chani is equally mesmerizing adding a touch of raw human emotion that makes the tale resonate with authenticitythe entire cast including the talents of rebecca ferguson javier bardem and josh brolin contribute to an arrakis that feels real and alive with political intrigue and social complexity this isnt just a movie its an experience that transcends the screen and stays with you long after the credits roll if you havent seen it yet youre missing out on a cinematic treasure,positive
499,apart from cinematography and set design the movie is average only the last half hour is worth it its occasionally overly philosophical and slowpaced reminiscent of prometheus at times and in atmosphere akin to blade runner surprisingly in a world where ai advances rapidly the special effects here are poorly done whether i am too old or if film standards have drastically declined is now a question perhaps i expected too much that sometimes happens with films that carry a certain weight i would praise austin butler whose acting at times reminds me of a young christian bale,positive
500,very bad acting by timothee and zendaya literally worst actors ever the dialogue is sophomorish and low iq the plot is predictable the script is just lame boring and crapthe acting is woody the costumes dont even look better than the costumes in the original s dune movie the original dune movie is x better than this overrated movie this movie has so many flat boring scenesif not for the over dramatic sound and sound effects i would have fallen asleep already did i say the acting is really bad seriously the original dune movie is x better and more original the characters in these new dune movies are just so shallow,negative
501,as a reader and book lover must admit that this movie is beyond and above paul atreides character breathes and lives on screen thanks to the immense and outstanding talent of timothee chalamet here is all that complexity entangled revenge sorrow doubt love betrayal self sacrifice and ambition downfall of man and rising of a leader chalamet definitely would be remembered as the space prince turned warrior his path through the desert from youthful man fighting his own gifts to a ruler of the galaxy challenging the great houses and fighting his way to the throneapart from the mind blowing acting of the lead characters villeneuve delivers the most beautiful and breathtaking visuals that contribute to the powerful heartbreaking epic deliverance of the story along with the hans zimmer masterpiece of a music main theme makes you feel the underlying sorrow the unconditional value of freedom even above love the sacrifice ultimate power demandsdune is not just for sci fi lovers it is a cinematic experience with layers of messages it is epic tale for war and love for great houses and blood lines an instant classic,positive

503,okay with every movie im hyped to see i always need at least showings for me to get a proper solid feeling on it so for the last week ive left all my thoughts to myself for me to truly think how i feel about this movie after my first showing i loved it but i came out with a feeling i wasnt satisfied and its probably because of the changes made from the novel whereas today i have no doubt in my head of how i feel this movie is perfecttheres genuinely so much i love about this that if i wanted i could go through every single scene and say how brilliant it is firstly with the movie itself the pacing is just godly how on earth is that an almost hour movie when it flies by faster than sand in the wind secondly the sound editing unbelievable the visuals are without a doubt just the best thing from vfx to camera work to cinematographybut finally the acting is where this movie shines every actor is honestly carrying this movie and thats what you expect with a stacked cast like this timothy is the definition of paul atreides he was born for this role and i pray its his legacy because he gave it his all and more the scene in the sietch with his fathers ducal signet is one of the best scenes ive ever seen his acting in the final scene is academy level he at the very least needs to be nominatedzendaya does wonders for chani especially for me as a huge dune series fan chani is a good character but she doesnt at all stand out in the books but when she was announced to be played by zendaya i knew this would be a twist and man im happy with the way denis took her arc shes probably my favourite character in the movie which is saying a lot with how shes not even top in the books its crazy how much facial expressions does and zendaya plays that perfectly the love she has you can read it just as well as the anger at the end i cannot wait to see how denis uses her in messiah especially with how shes on a complete different path nowthe final actor that really stood out for me is austin butler doesnt have the biggest screen time but his role is perfect and i knew it the moment you hear him laughing in his arena battle he plays this role in such a way it made me care for feydrautha even though hes a little no villain with little character outside of that i could go on about every actor because they all do something that makes this movie special but yeah overall just a brilliant cast and a perfect moviethe final thing i have to say is that score that plays from the moment the emperor kisses the ducal signet till the end of the movie and the score during the credits godly level of work from zimmer he was the best choice for this movie and he delivered beyond perfection for both parts,positive

505,when i watched the first part some time ago i wasnt very impressed the film was very slow and the excitement didnt start until the last minutes this film on the other hand was thrilling from start to finish there were many memorable moments and the excitement was tense most of the time the fact that time flew like a bird while watching this film was a special expression that there was no lack of excitementalso i cant say that the film was too abrupt there was love depression and compassion very cleverly woven in the film offered the whole spectrum of emotionsspeaking of the actors timothe chalamet as paul atreides did an excellent job offering both character development and the inner dilemmas of gaining power one could get quite a deep understanding of the phrase power corrupts austin butler as feydrautha was also excellent the inner psychological instability reflected in him was extremely convincingvisually the film was extremely well made combined with the music by hanz zimmer the visuals were so evocative that in some moments i found myself shivering definitely a film to experience in the cinema excellent,positive
506,fantastic film the sound was incredible great film super enjoyable enough action to offset slower parts the film just builds in intensity to a fantastic climax just blown away when i walked out of the theater there was an older gentlemen and he looked shell shocked he looked at me and said oh my god that was an amazing film just saw it tonight friday mar with my son and im taking my other son tomorrow its that good i am so glad to see it in a movie theater compared to waiting to watch it at home you definitely want the whole soundvisual experience of a good theater if you are on the fence post about seeing it dont hesitate youll love it,positive
507,dont get me wrong it was breathtaking always on the edge great visuals but once the dust settled no pun intended i also realised this was part of the problem there was never any break of any kind it was the same thing the whole time always dark always action filled a tension the whole time but never really all that interesting either intense is the word for it all the timeboy and mother arrive at desert town mother drinks blue water boy passes a test and fights boy goes south after an attack raises an army and destroys emperor army the bug battles are awful wins sword fight against emperors boy goes after other houses who refuse him as new emperorthe fact he is related to some of the evil guys isnt interesting i am your father but boringthats it i almost got a bit bored except that you cant because its always in your face weird feelingand it is in this sense that the childrens movie star wars ivvi suddendly appears more superior not that they are comparable one is sort of a feel good family movie the other is this dark piece that is brutalbut what i mean by thaf is that at least there were different plots and sub stories and ultimately you cared about so many characterswithout naming star wars charachter names anyone will remember who i mean when i saytwo robotsa little green being with magical powerantihero smuggler and his alien type bear sidekicka princess and the princethe evil fathertry that with dune and its just a mush of different people fighting killing servants or having loud powerful voiceswith dune there is mostly fighting and not much else and then shortly after i walked out i realised the only character i care a little bit about but not that much either is chanii didnt care about anything else i didnt even know what exactly i should care for in the next episode should i really care about whether there will be a paradise or not or who will lead the fremen to it is that the point of it thats itthe best part about the movie is probably that it has strong female lead characters or at least theyre not second to the menagain its not a bad movie and i was tending between or more towards but at the time of writing it has and thats like movie of the decade type level way too highso i just think it has to come down quite a bit so for a fairer evaluation giving it a sorry fabs,positive
508,i read the book around when the first part of dune was released so i knew what would happen storywise but while watching part two i realized its not just about the main plot its the music its the visuals the sounds the acting the rawnessi think everything in this movie is perfect when you see it from a visual and sound perspectivewhile i think the story is wonderful i feel it was almost too fast phased i discussed with friends who has not read the book about the story which they did not really understand at all times because of the movies fast phase in the second half of the moviei wont discuss these specific storywise stuff but when you see the movie from a bookperspective the story is exceptional and richwhile i know you cant really copypaste the book to the movie it still contains the main plot points and does so with excellence but i cant deny that i wanted to see some more things that was included in the book but not in the moviecertain characters cough cough seemed to be forgotten from the first partbut overall i totally loved the movie and i also like that it takes its own little road to make it a better cinematic experience but i know that some will whine about the difference between book and movie i think its great that they make the movie in a way that still cherish the source material but does some changes probably are necessary for production and overall experienceif youll whine about the movie not being exactly like the book you should just go read the book i really hope an extended cut will be released for us all to enjoy this movie in h instead of i would perhaps put this movie in the area but since this is imdb it deserves a thanks,positive
509,i loved part one and was really hopeful of a satisfying ending but was left disappointedi am a big fan of the books and feel previous attempts at visual interpretations have been underwhelming the first film changed that it set the world and characters up thoroughly and steadily it was long but merited the running time part two was a let downin this film the good work is somewhat wasted dont get me wrong this is not a bad film it just has some problemsquite long sections were boring the focus on certain characters and personal issues were given far too much screen time zendayas chani im sorry but it was like the director was getting a bonus for every second she was on screen which might have been fine if the character was not portrayed in such a petulant and petty way her huff at the end of the film encapsulated this fine to make her role bigger but it was done poorlychalamets paul did not develop convincingly or at all in the first film he played the character to a tee but this time the writing left him the childish boy seemingly throughout his ascendance to the mahdikwisatz haderach via the water of life was not given anything like a vision indeed throughout the film hishis mothers visions and the more mystical parts of the story were left out or completely underplayed and left you at a loss why he was suddenly behaving so differentlynotable things were left out in particular the navigators but also other elements you would assume would be in heretoo much long stares into the sand i love the visuals and the whole mythos of this universe but as a big fan i was sitting there bored several timestheir were some real highlights pauls first riding of the worm was really well done the whole section on geidi prime was really great the fightbattle scenes were done really well also the senior actors were all fantastic shame the young leads could not match thema noble effort with flaws,positive
510,dune part two despite its ambitious attempt to continue the epic saga falls significantly short of the expectations set by its predecessor leaving much to be desired in both narrative depth and character development where denis villeneuves first installment offered a visually stunning and philosophically rich entrance into the universe of frank herberts iconic series this sequel struggles to maintain that momentum veering into the realm of cinematic redundancy and superficial spectaclethe films pacing is one of its most glaring issues it oscillates between rushed sequences that skim over crucial plot points and tedious stretches where little of consequence happens this erratic tempo not only disrupts the narrative flow but also undermines the storys emotional weight leaving the audience disengaged from what should be highstakes momentscharacter development or the lack thereof further detracts from the films appeal newcomers to the cast are introduced with great fanfare but are given scant screen time to evolve beyond onedimensional figures this oversight is particularly disappointing given the rich backstories and intricate personalities that define herberts characters even returning characters who were previously portrayed with depth and complexity are reduced to mere shadows of their former selves often acting out of character or being pushed to the sidelinesvisually dune part two continues to impress with its breathtaking landscapes and meticulous attention to detail in costume and production design however these aesthetic achievements cannot compensate for the films narrative shortcomings the reliance on cgi spectacle over substantive storytelling feels like a missed opportunity to explore the novels themes of power ecology and human naturemoreover the script seems to struggle with balancing the source materials dense political intrigue with the need for blockbuster action sequences as a result much of the films potential for thoughtful commentary on imperialism and environmentalism is lost in translation replaced by generic battle scenes that lack the emotional resonance seen in the first filmin conclusion dune part two is a visually captivating but ultimately unsatisfying continuation of the dune saga its failure to capitalize on the groundwork laid by its predecessor results in a sequel that feels both overloaded and superficial while diehard fans may find moments to enjoy those seeking the depth and nuance of the original will likely be left wanting more this sequel unfortunately suggests that in attempting to broaden its appeal the franchise has sacrificed the very elements that made it distinctive and compelling in the first place,positive
511,dune part two is a visually stunning and emotionally powerful film that is sure to leave a lasting impression the story is epic in scope yet it never loses sight of the personal stakes involved the characters are complex and welldeveloped and the performances are topnotch timothe chalamet is particularly good as paul atreides and he brings a real depth and nuance to the role the film is also beautifully shot with stunning cinematography and special effects the music is also incredible and it really helps to create an immersive and atmospheric experienceoverall dune part two is a masterpiece of modern cinema it is a mustsee for fans of science fiction epic films and great acting i highly recommend it,positive

515,dune part is a breathtaking visual extravaganza that not only provides the next chapter in the dune universe but also takes you on a spiritual journey the film begins where the last film left offwe see paul and his mother lady jessica integrate within the culture of fremen and just like the first film the culture and customs of the fremen are explained seamlessly they have their own languagetheir religion and propheciesthe way they value and preserve water is also explained the cast just like the last film is phenomenal and everyone just crushes it on the screen timothee chalamet and rebecca ferguson once again carry the emotional heft of the story perfectly as paul atreides accepts his place as the messiah while lady jessica becomes a spiritual leader to the fremen because of her bene gesserit past javier bardem and zendaya get to shine as stilgar and chani respectively stilgars belief in the prophecy and its implications is conveyed exceptionally by mr bardem while zendaya does a great job as chani a brave fremen soldier who loves paul but is constantly at loggerheads with the prophecy austin butler as feud ratha stands out immensely he is ferocious blood thirsty and a psychotic maniac florence pugh as princess irulan is contemplative and devoted to her father but does not have much to do in the story the cinematography in this movie by greg frasier exceeds expectations and it should definitely be watched on the biggest screen possible this film also has a lot more action than the first film and the action scenes are visceral and very entertaining to watch on the big screen this film overall is a satisfying conclusion to the story setup in the first installment even though this film definitely sets up future installments the score by hans zimmer is epic which might be an understatement but the score arouses you when paul ascends and take his place as the lisanal ghaib the score during the action scenes will also pump you up director denis villenueue understands that despite the epic scope of this film it still is pauls journey and he takes it to fruition here an absolute sure shot recommend one of the best cinematic experiences ive ever had,positive
516,how often these days can you say a sequel surpasses the first film now i understand that this is technically a second part of one whole story however the depth and scale of this film is remarkable that deserves commendation to all involved who have pushed it beyond the first film in every way it is truly a masterpiece a film that will be talked about for generations and one that will undoubtedly become a classic of cinema a book that many thought would be impossible to fully convey through film has finally had its triumph on the big screen thanks to the mastermind that is denis villenevue,positive
517,id like to start my review by saying im not a sci fi fan i dont get the genre but this well this dune and completely and utterly shattered that notionthe cinematography visuals soundscapes and music are just so incredible so far ahead of its time so magnificent my brain literally couldnt copeim actually grateful that dialogue was kept to a minimum because there is just so much to take in and absorb that dealing with bloated dialogue would have ruined it completely for meinstead this film relies on iconic scenes memorable heart wrenching sounds majestic visuals that leave your jaw dropping and landscapes that have you thinking this cant be reali watched it on imax but am going back a nd time to watch on normal screen in the cinema and have already preordered on apple tv because this was for me a once in a lifetime cinematic experience,positive
518,the effects and cinematography was amazing it was visually flawless the sandworm attacking at the climax was absolutely amazingthe story had much to be desired i kept waiting to be moved by the storyline but it never happened there just wasnt anything to connect me to the main characters dune we were connected by the lose of his father and his people we wanted to see paul get his revenge but somehow that got lost and didnt translate to dune twothe time line jumps around and too often i was wondering how we got to one moment from the nextthe dialog was hard to follow and i wasnt sure what was the motive of paul most of the timethe end when we were supposed to be satisfied by paul and the fremens victory just seemed to miss the mark most memorable franchises move you emotionally and you are along for the ride but not this movie,positive
519,dune part two is not just a film its an immersive journey that envelops you in its vast mesmerizing universe as a fan of the first installment i eagerly anticipated this sequel and it exceeded all expectations denis villeneuves direction brings frank herberts world to life with such depth and authenticity that you feel transported to the sands of arrakis yourself what struck me most was the perfect balance of cgi usage while the film relies heavily on visual effects to portray its otherworldly landscapes and creatures it never feels overdone or artificial instead the cgi enhances the storytelling seamlessly blending with practical effects to create a believable and aweinspiring world from the towering sandworms to the intricate architecture of the fremen sietches every detail feels meticulously crafted drawing you further into the narrative its a testament to the filmmakers skill that even in the most visually stunning sequences the focus remains on the characters and their emotional journey as i watched dune part two i found myself completely immersed in its world captivated by its beauty and complexity its a rare feat for a film to strike such a perfect balance between spectacle and substance and for that it deserves all the praise it receives in my eyes dune part two is not just a sequel its a cinematic masterpiece,positive
520,i was really looking forward to dune part in the hope that it would be better than part one dont get me wrong p was a decent effort and set the scene reasonably well for the second instalment sadly i was disappointedmuch of the criticism of the original lynch movie stemmed from the fact that lynch altered a few of the key aspects of the novel but the same can be said of villeneuves production too id argue lynchs changes are far less problematic at least he kept alia and the guild navigators and didnt consign them to footnotes what the hell is spaihts and villeneuve talking about when they say the passion for letos death in p would be diminished with a time jump of a few years to p just so they could avoid casting a child actor in the role of pauls sister it makes no sense and diminishes p immenselyon the guild navigators not appearing in the original novel well the whole point of introducing them in the lynch movie and the tv shows was to emphasise who had the real power in the universe and who it was that paul had to defeat to become the god emperor by leaving them out it needs some other vehicle to persuade the audience of the jeopardy faced by the atreides dynasty and their fremen followers this production fails on that scoremy main problem with p however is the whole alteration of the time from the start of p to the end of p in the novel and the lynch movie there was no such problem by cramming so much into such a short period of less than a year rather than the years of the book the whole feeling of the film becomes messy and disjointed maybe it was due to the budget constraints m is not a lot for a movie these days lynchs movie cost m over years ago today we would expect at least m if not m for such a prestigious movie with so much expectation far greater than in both p p have been hyped up a great deal and rightly so audiences ought to expect a genuine epic from such great source material and with a strong history of visual productions however the end result was a space drama with no drama a lack lustre soundtrack mediocre acting a lame script and a messy screenplay i dont even think the costumes were all that good no style no panache no drama no humour no intriguechalamet ought to have been able to mature in his role but he wasnt given the chance im not entirely convinced he could have pulled it off anyway he looks like a young skinny teen at the end of p just as he did at the start of p the same cannot be said of kyle maclachlan whose paul muaddib atreides would have had millions of fremen warriors chasing after him across the galaxy i couldnt see the fremen following chalamet into battle on arrakis let alone on a crusade to decimate the universe lets not even mention the missing characters in p or the unsatisfactory relationship of paul and chani i never felt warm to any of the characters which i did in both the original and the tv showsevery omission and alteration creates problems that go beyond the basic story it made the movie feel more like a first draft rather than the finished article god knows how much was left on the cutting room floor but if what we ended up with is the best the editor could give us then he either deserves an oscar or never to be hired againno thufir hawat no count fenring no guild navigators no child alia no leto atreides ii no harah there is a reason these characters exist in the novel and why leaving them out makes for a far less satisfying evening at the theatre will there be a part villeneuve says it makes sense but if hes going to butcher dune messiah as much as he did with dune then im not sure anyone should give him the budgeti gave part one i give part two simply because it is worse than p when it should have been better,positive
521,i read the book over years ago i saw the david lynch version and the crappy tv versions guess what they are better this this rubbishplot holes are deeper than dunes this whole saga didnt need movies lynch did a great job with tech of the day how many scenes of empty sand do we need to see before we realise that we are being ripped offf big timeabosute crap why on dunes earth did chiani have a nyc accent when stilgar was an arabchiani never did what she did at the end of the book and she was never portrayed as an activist where was alia oh dear ooops pathetic movie,positive
522,dune part two a triumphant return to arrakis denis villeneuves dune part two isnt just a sequel its a cinematic culmination a harmonious fusion of aweinspiring visuals profound storytelling and pulsepounding action this film transcends the limitations of mere science fiction establishing itself as a grand operatic experience that will leave audiences breathlesshaving laid the groundwork in the first part villeneuve dives headfirst into the heart of frank herberts legendary saga paul atreides timothe chalamet is no longer the wideeyed dukes son haunted by visions and burdened by his messianic destiny he walks a tightrope between prophecy and peril chalamet delivers a powerful performance capturing pauls inner turmoil and burgeoning leadership with remarkable nuancethe supporting cast shines even brighter zendayas chani emerges as a formidable warrior and pauls emotional anchor rebecca ferguson masterfully portrays lady jessica a mother caught between love for her son and the machinations of the bene gesserit javier bardem brings a gravitas and charisma to stilgar the leader of the fremen that resonates deeply each character is meticulously crafted their motivations and complexities woven into the narrative tapestryvisually dune part two is a feast for the eyes the filmmakers have conjured a breathtaking vision of arrakis a desert planet teeming with danger and wonder the sandworms are even more aweinspiring their gargantuan forms slithering across the dunes in sequences that redefine cinematic scale the costume and production design are equally impressive transporting viewers to a world both familiar and alienthe action sequences are masterfully choreographed and executed the film doesnt shy away from depicting the brutality of combat but the violence serves a purpose highlighting the stakes of pauls struggle the use of sound design further elevates these scenes with the thunderous roar of the sandworms and the whine of lasguns creating a truly immersive experiencebut dune part two is more than just spectacle villeneuve delves deeper into herberts themes of ecology colonialism and religious fanaticism the film explores the consequences of unchecked ambition and the dangers of succumbing to messianic fervor pauls journey is not a clearcut path to heroism its a harrowing exploration of power and its corrupting influencethe score by hans zimmer deserves special mention its a powerful and evocative soundscape that perfectly complements the films visuals and emotional core the music throbs with a primal energy mirroring the harsh beauty of arrakis and the inner struggles of its charactersdune part two is a rare cinematic achievement its a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll prompting reflection and discussion its a testament to the power of storytelling a visually stunning epic that resonates on a deeply human level this is not just a mustsee for fans of the first film its a mustsee for anyone who appreciates grand thoughtprovoking cinema in a world saturated with sequels and franchises dune part two stands out as a masterpiece a film that fully deserves its perfect rating,positive
523,i dont often rate a movie a my favorites are usually or but this is the definition of the looks and personality in all seriousness denis villeneuve created something that can only be described as huge epic grandiose while still developing characters and applying beautiful detail i love how he set up so many things in the first film to be paid off in part two shots of the dessert mouse maud dib pauls awareness of gurney hallecks gate javier bardem as stilgar absolutely crushes it he couldnt be better and deserves oscaranother recognition timothy goes from a boy in the first to leading man that demands your attention both as an actor an in his characterim a dune reader and of course things had to be cut from the book but i appreciate dvs selectiveness to make it a believable universe very rarely does this happen but the movies may just outshine the source materialive never watched at hour movie and wished it was though it will probably be years i cant wait for dune messiah,positive
524,brilliant epic visually stunning a treat for the senses a cinematic masterpiece sets the bar for science fiction movies a truly immersive experience that transports you for nearly hours to another world a listers brought their a game testosterone and estrogen oozed off the screen battle scenes and hand to hand combat to rival anything that came before it truly a creative spectacle to behold no disappointments here incredible cinematography world building costume design score editing and acting makes this not only the best scifi film of the year but probably of the decade will for sure be nominated for several oscars and will be considered one of the greatest of all time,positive
525,first off dune part two does justice to frank herberts visions when he authored the book the complex thoughts and writing from the novel is carried out beautifully as the story switches out between separate planets and settings and ultimately creating different cinematic experiences every half hour or sofocusing less on comparisons around the book dune part two feels unique to the first movie regarding their similarities of how part two upscales everything that part one did right and removed every criticism i had with it the pacing of dune part two is crafted excellentlyeach arc in the story is written and filmed like a greek epic with timothe chalamet being your heracles simple dialogues will distract you with beautiful sunsets and brutal battles immerse you with the sense of victory or the pain of lossi especially was a fan of austin butlers performance as one of antagonists and his acting was downright horrific at times when mere logic causes an advisor to have his throat slit due to feyds psychotic tendencieschalamet stepping up as a leader in his heros journey is a transcendent experience as he quickly transforms from bland intelligent and strong rich kid to a planning politician with a guide to his goals within his mind overall paul atreidus becomes an actually interesting characterthis movie had some unintentional comedic moments the fremens reaction to anything that paul did made my nearentire theater laugh three timesalready this review is getting very long but props to hans zimmer for creating yet another majestic score for a moviethats not all i have to say but you get the picture,positive
526,this film is visual poetry you just have to see to appreciate you just never one it to end sound is something people my take for granted in a film or maybe not think about but from the sound track to the explanations and the deadly environment around you it just felt so real i loved the seriousnsss of this movie it was do or die and left you fully emursed all the new characters were brilliant the development of the story is fantastic couldnt have asked for more other than being gready and wanting more if i had to pick something negative maybe the big fight seen could have done with an extra minutes to be more detailed and should the real strategy involved but honestly probably just me wanting more beautiful,positive
527,i had a unique cinematic experience with this masterpiece i had a unique cinematic experience with this masterpiece the transformation of the characters and political conflicts as well as the music and visual production are terrifying and greatas you continue this part your appreciation for the character of leto atreides will increase as for paul atreides he works on two contradictory characters the first is the original paul and the second is the schoolteacher as you continue this part your appreciation for the character of leto atreides will increase as for paul atreides he works on two contradictory characters the first is the original paul and the second is the moadeb the beautiful shock and the wonderful plot which is that paul is a harken is very beautiful and deserves praisegreat work of artthanks dune,positive
528,he loves setting the mood and oh lord he does it well but he does it too muchthis movie just like the others he directed needs a bunch of cuts paul keeps looking at chani over and over again we understand we dont need you to remind us seven times in the scenea lot of scenes are too exhausted too long id remove maybe more than minutes of excessive and repetitive mood setting scenes seriously great music powerful visuals awesome designs but please denis stop making your films longer than needed people complained about seeing frodos face over and over again this guy does the same until we just want to punch our eyes,positive
529,dune part one ranks in my top of all time so my anticipation for this film was skyhighthe positives the movie showcases incredible creativity and breathtaking visuals the costume design is particularly striking and the ensemble cast delivers standout performances across the boardhowever there are some drawbacks around the midway point something felt off rebecca ferguson and timothy chalamets characters seemed to undergo a sudden transformation almost as if they forgot who they were while character development is expected this shift felt jarring and poorly explained the pacing also felt inconsistent with moments dragging while others rushed by this reminded me of the character arc of daenerys targaryen in game of thrones where her evolution felt sudden and unearned additionally the desert setting dominates the film creating a feeling of monotony throughout what made part one special seems lacking in part two theres a sense of missing that extra touch or uniqueness,positive
530,saw at a regal rpx and after i was told they only sell the popcorn buckets at amc i had new time on my hands so actually went inglad i did had that holy smokes how are they doing this feeling i havent had since i was watching jurassic park in the theatre its been years since they have been able to show some really new exciting aspects of film making this creativity is just wownot the yo feelings i thought i was getting into tonight but still just left the theatre sweaty excited and in a relaxed state of euphoria also cant wait to go back for round immediatelygo see this on the biggest screen you can,positive
531,i had not read any of the dune books so the only guide i had to the story and characters was the first film i thought dune was okish but nothing special it didnt grab me at all i hadnt intended to see dune ii but did so after reading the many good reviews im afraid my take on this one was pretty much the same as that on the first at times it looked like whole scenes had been missed out as though they were being saved for an extendededition dvd and so it was very difficult for me to follow the story as there seemed to be no continuity and no rationale for what was actually taking place on screen will i be going to see dune iii as inevitably there will be one probably not rated purely for the special effects,positive
532,its a shame because the first movie was more accurate and loyal to the book except the hakonnen being bald but in this movie they went fine for the first hours and then its a free fallthe ending was really disappointing and not even close to the book where was princess alia a really important character that was left out how long can jessica be pregnant its ridiculousmaybe they should have made another movie and give more attention to the final battlepeople who didnt read the book or saw the first movie from dont know that the plot is different and perhaps thats why they think its a masterpiece well its not,positive
533,dune part two it has come to full fruition denis villeneuves dune series might be the greatest scifi series in cinematic history the new age of cinema has shown its potential to not just adapt in filmmaking but to show a great storyline and potentially become a classic in centuries to come and i believe that with all of my heart denis villeneuves dune series will be the scifi film that will share the throne as the greatest amongst the classicsits a wild thing to say for a latestrelease film and i do understand the recency bias phenomenon among moviegoers but i also believe denis dune will grow on people from time to time as i felt that myself with dune part one rewatches and also my observation on the audiences latest reviews on dune part one rewatchthere are two eyewitnesses to this film the novel nonreaders and the readers it is a bipartite review as to how they perceived this film and i can say that im jealous of how nonreaders might perceive this film while i might see the words becoming a full visualization im also trying to perceive how nonreaders see its storyfrom this statement its due to how there are quite plenty of omissions and changes in the storyline from the novel and the way im wording it doesnt indicate a bad thing but its a huh moment for me as i immersed myself in the story with a new perception i believe most nonreaders will see it as a linear perfect storyline but its different for me and this is not entirely a bad thingto sum up the statement denis and jon have done a tremendous job on the storyline and screenwriting and i have to say its the best decision yet to make the storyline go in the other direction most of the new scenes leave me in a great shock at how well told it is and how unexpectedly it turned out to be played especially the endingthe words for this storyline are more fierce and crueldune part two is an experience not just a film of fiction it is dramatic in its depth poignant in its love story profound and cruel in its motive and epic in its style thats grandeur and maximized to near perfectionim blown away by how denis managed to achieve this level of mastery in an adaptation of the greatest scifi novel in history dune part two is a masterpiece and beautifully adaptedit just gets bettermoving away from the main thematic entrance to this cinematic desert masterpiece i just have to talk about the ingredients that make this film as spicy as it getsthe cinematography is topnotch and one of the most remarkable aspects of this film the film was a whole hours and minutes of eyecatching experience to be immersed on a big screen this film managed to capture lots of moments in this scene thatll make you go hell yeah thats firethe color grading for this film has its way to be most deliberate and nonsubtle but will make you feel the atmospheric changes in the film capturing the moment so well with how it is done youll know what i mean hereall this couldnt be done without the creative mind of greg frasier and perfect visualizations by denis villeneuve reading the texts and seeing how its done in the film is one of the blessings i felt in my cinematic experiencehans zimmer is truly a work of art his craft manages to consistently elevate one after the other in his film scores the dune part two soundtrack is perfectly conveyed with the instruments played and will put you in every emotion to be felt in this filmi believe timothe chalamet has outdone himself in this film there are many doubts lingering about this young actor but this film will definitely solidify them the acting was fierce and potent enough to grip you to the edge of your seat and im going to tell you to prepare for whats to comeit has always been a topic of him being overrated but hopefully dune part two will prove doubters wrong and how talented timothe actually is one of the greatest young actors in this new era of cinema with a wide range of actingaustin butler as feydrautha is exceptional casting that is once again unexpected like timothe said in an interview he has to prove himself for this film and now its austins turn and hes actually done it it is not an exaggeration when the word psychotic is thrown around he truly isdare i say it feydrautha is way more psychotic and villainous than he is in the novel and you just have to witness iti have every word to say about each actor and actress but i couldnt prolong it timothe and austin are prime examples of how wellacted this film is and you guys have to witness others acting masterfully on the big screenmy honorable mention before ending this review is how perfectly they created the chakobsa languagedavid peterson and denis managed to give this language depth with how dramatic the language sounds when its spoken it doesnt feel made up for the sake of being an incomprehensible language but rather realistic and feltdune part two is definitely worth a watch as its healing scifi and action cinema right now and i think everyone deserves to experience this in their lifetime go watch it while you have the chance on the big screen,positive
534,this is one of the best movies ive ever watched gooosebumpsi think i puts the whole dune univers in another great movie perspective this followup on the dune part is just epic the universe buildup from the first movie to the action packed secound movie is so amazing furthermore the whole movie had me on the edge of the seat i really think it gave the future for scifi a real competition and generelly theres is a long distance between such great universe describtions i love the way that the water and the dessert are set up as two opposites and how the water plays a giant role in the rightful rulers og dunes religionthis is a must watch,positive
535,dune part is an absolute masterpiece that captivates from start to finish denis villeneuves visionary direction coupled with hans zimmers mesmerizing score creates an unparalleled cinematic experience the music alone is enough to transport you to the hauntingly beautiful world of arrakis but combined with stunning visuals and a compelling narrative it elevates the film to greatnessone of the standout aspects of dune part is its lingering kind of vibe which immerses the audience into the rich tapestry of the dune universe from the vast deserts to the intricate politics every detail is meticulously crafted making the world feel both expansive and livedin this attention to detail extends to the characters as well each of whom is brought to life with depth and complexitystorywise dune part is driven and never feels out of touch the film maintains a calm pace allowing the tension to simmer and build gradually every scene feels purposeful leading to a climactic conclusion that leaves you on the edge of your seat villeneuve masterfully balances exposition with action ensuring that the audience is always engagedone of the most impressive aspects of dune part is its ability to convey a sense of scale from the towering sandworms to the sprawling cities everything feels epic in scope yet amidst the grandeur there is also an intimacy to the story as it explores themes of power destiny and the human conditionthe performances in dune part are nothing short of stellar timothe chalamet shines as the conflicted hero paul atreides bringing both vulnerability and strength to the role rebecca ferguson is equally compelling as pauls mother lady jessica while oscar isaac delivers a commanding performance as duke leto atreides the supporting cast including zendaya jason momoa and javier bardem also deliver standout performances adding depth and texture to the filmoverall dune part is a triumph of filmmaking its rare to find a movie that excels on so many levels but villeneuve has managed to create a cinematic masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come whether youre a fan of science fiction or simply appreciate great storytelling dune part is not to be missed,positive
536,i have no critic really im still processing im even satisfied by the changes that they made at the end of the story high key i hope monsieur villeneuve did a directors cut with more graphic scenes dont get me wrong it wasnt really missing but it would of added a layer to it all and would of given more depth to a few characters yes especially feydrautha the brutalist terror wasnt explicit enough for mezendaya was brilliant she truly showed no fear on the screen in a way i rarely seen anyone do it beforebut truly while watching it you just feel how much care everyone who has worked on this movie has giving flawlessi left the cinema feeling like i just got taught a few lessons and i want to feel and understand morecant wait to be blown way by dune messiahalso weirdly enough it totally damaged the way i thought about star wars like there isnt even a conversation to be had,positive
537,do yourselves a favour and go see it now i was so enthralled by the first part that as soon as i stepped out of the theater i ordered the original books i was so surprised to find that it was not an ordinary scifi novel but that it was a beautiful blend of religion philosophy politics and history part two does justice to the first book and the adaptations such as alia not being born yet didnt bother me at all i understand it would have been an impossible task to find a child actor for the part the cinematography and the music were again simply outstanding as was timothee chalamet the speech he gave in front of the fremen leaders gave me the goosebumps all in all its the best movie ive seen in a good while,positive
538,theres not a lot you can pick apart in this movie pacing progression action romance well what romance there is in it the way it was shot and the way hans zimmer works his magic as per usual i wish i had read the books before viewing as the world building is so fascinating i love that the world is scifi and includes the fremen society as well which is very middle eastern based and include djinn and shamans the combination of the two was such a wonderful idea that dune novelist frank herbert had and i am thankful that he created this world for us to enjoy timothy does a great job as paul and zendaya as chani austin butler though i was super pleased to hear him not sound like elvis he really played this character brutally and it was so necessary stellan skarsgaard is incredible as you would expect and i could also picture gary oldman in the role as the baron as well just a side note i would highly recommend watching this right after rewatching the first and enjoy it i hope they build more on this universe but please dont oversaturate it am i right,positive
539,dune is a very hard book to capture on the screen so this was a monumental accomplishmentthe movie captures the atmosphere of the universe very well and is cinematographically very nice the movie stays pretty true to the book i read the book when i was years of age to be honest most of the movie is how i moreorless imagined things to look like in my mindthe dialogue on this movie is a little dry not everything is thoroughly explained which the books probably do a better job of some characters could have used more development but i dont remember if thats an issue with the source materialthis movie follows the general recent trend of improving movie quality in cinema after about a decade or so of marvel dominance it is unique artistic and detailed and tackles a large scale project,positive
540,theres nothing wrong with gratuitous cinematography it was beautifully done but i felt like it was visuals at the expense of storytelling there are a lot of nuances in dune that could have been brought out in the film if they had paced a little bit better where was alia the way the screenplay was written the expected you to believe that paul had his meteoric rise to messiah and they were somehow able to put a huge dent in spice production all in about months in the bookand in all other adaptations it was clear that this happened over a long period of time maybe years which made more sense missing that scene of a freakishly wise toddler stabbing her evil fat grandfather in the neck really dampened my experience justiceforstaliaoftheknife,positive
541,there were so many moments where my friend and i look each other in the eyes on a no homo basis with our mouthed opendennis villeneuve camera usage was phenomenal the shots were crazy the pace was perfect with no really boring momentswith my friend and i being producers the sound scape was magnificent hans zimmer der hammerim dont really care that much about the acting i think doesnt need much to convince me thats probably why my friends can gas light me so easily really nothing to complain about hours and minutes is really perfect with a quick breakreally a from me,positive
542,this movie felt like a load of guilty pleasure i enjoyed it and had fun but most great things about the movie are credited to the book aka the plot lore setting characters politics etc the filmmaking part of it beside cinematography was mediocre to good at best the emotion range and believability of characters for example every single character had one single role in this movie no depth complexity or character development the dramatic scenes were extremely bad why would shani look at the screen giving her back to the enemies during a wardisappointed but still enjoyed it,positive
543,meaningless talks talks and again meaningless talks so boringdid i mentioned meaningless talks yes indeed so boringit is impossible to watch without sleepingalso costumes and enviorement are so boring desert desert and again desertyou have to be so patiret to watchcharacters are so plain nothing to wonder about itmusic so boring also nothing good about this film nothing good indeed how people give star is not understable i will repeat what i said in the firs place the movie is so noring and boring and boring do not waste your time watching this film go and watch any another movie thats all,negative
544,this movie is simply a masterpiece it will be a pillar of science fiction genre hat off to denis as he is one of the best directors of his generation it still amazes me how this man cant do an average movie he understands how movies works he puts the accents on character development story visuals sound to deliver us immersive experiences like no others everything works perfectly in this movie i just didnt want it to end it shoks me to see people rating movies just because zendaya was in it or because its too long or because they didnt like the music it just goes to show how little some people understand movies and the effort put by the creators to offer the best cinematic experience possible as a fun fact no director or producer starts off by wanting to do a bad movie even the most mediocre movies i cant rate them with less than or stars let alone give it a star because i didnt like one thing completely ignoring the other things that make it great writing this i feel the need to go see it one more time good day my fellow movie lovers,positive
545,bold statement incoming the combination of dune part one and dune part two has officially become my favorite film adaptation of a book the profound impact of frank herberts epic science fiction masterpiece on both literature and religion is not to be overshadowed by denis villeneuves visionary homage this is the book come to life and if you appreciate the book the movie should resonate deeply with youi struggle to think of a betterexecuted sequel though the empire strikes back and the dark knight are certainly in the running dune part two excels beyond both its strength lies in the combination of jawdropping worldbuilding extraordinary acting and a script that allows the audiovisual experience to unfold effortlessly dune is a spiritual journey deeply rooted in muslim culture and western colonialisms quest for natural resources which is even more relevant today as it was nearly years ago when the book was written ie the spice which always equated to oil in my mindaesthetically the film has no equal which is no surprise considering the directors extraordinary track record including blade runner arrival and sicario all of which are in my top films of all time and deserving of a perfect along with dune part one dune part two exceeds its predecessor in every way elevating the story in such climactic fashion that my heart and mind were positively buzzing for a solid minutes it has no weak link no tonal inconsistency and no extended dip in energy or overexplanation in which to lose the viewer it is a perfect film from my perspective and likely to crack my top alltime i will reserve final judgment until i can see it in mm imax next week,positive

548,dune part two is one of the few movies that have ranked so high in a long time as well as one of the best science fiction movies ever madethis movie takes us deeper into arrakis where after the murderous fall of house of atreides led by the forces of baron vladimir harkonnen stellan skarsgrd commanded by lord rabban dave bautista as seen in the first dune movie in this second part paul timothee chalamet and lady jessica rebecca ferguson exposed by the harkonnen after devastatingly losing their family join forces with chani zendaya and the fremen the local people of arrakis long before the harkonnen first arrived paul sets on a journey to learn the ways of the desert while lord rabban has full authoritarian control of arrakis to boost the production of spice to its full capacity in order to gain full control of the planet after paul passes the most important lesson in the fremen training taught by stilgar javier bardem he ascends paul and becomes lisan algaib the leader of their people with the duty of proving that he is the fremens last hope of taking back arrakis and freeing the fremen from battling with the harkonnen paul learns that his power to predict the future has grown stronger lady jessica after becoming the reverend mother of the fremen gets pregnant of a baby girl to be pauls younger sister but its not too long before gurney halleck josh brolin returns making a failed attempt to ambushing the harkonnen in order to make them more vulnerable gurney makes his way towards the fremen camp where he reunites with recently ascended paul and lady jessica as things happen in arrakis the baron vladimir harkonnen requesta his psychotic nephew feydrautha austin butler to join him on their same mission joining him and lord rabban to take arrakis as their own control it and then kill the last three known members of house of atreides along with the fremen once and for all in order to dominate arrakis with the full production of spice by their side as the fremen plan their strategy to ambush the harkonnen the emperor christopher walken and his daughter the princess irulan florence pugh learn that paul atreides is alive after suppossing that the attempt to murdering paul lord rabban succeeded in taking him out along with every single member of the house of atreides during the houses fall the emperor princess irulan along with their fleet make their way to arrakis in order to take out paul atreides and boost the production of spice to gain control but then the fremen along with paul and gurneys help roll the dice and take on the emperor and the harkonnen after the emperor was found responsible for the death of duke leto atreides he finds himself exposed and recently made more vulnerable the fremen recently successful in the battle for their freedom against the harkonnen cheer up paul finds himself hungry for revenge against the emperor but instead has a deadly combat with feydrautha in which paul eventually succeeds following his success he is assigned to the emperors throne but since paul wanted more he doesnt express interest in sitting on it he wanted power freedom and mostly avenge the death of his father and the fall of the house of atreides princess irulan begs paul to spare his fathers life in exchange of assigning herself to be pauls wife action that leads to pauls ultimate betrayal against chani which devastates her and leads her to leaving the fremen alliance paul after seeing her walk away disappointed by this socalled betrayal act paul says absolutely nothing then decides to make the grand move attack all the great houses after the exposure of the emperor and the loss of his power which well see in dune part three,positive
549,funny comment a giant cult follows a brave teenage boy with mommy issues who suffered the death of his father gets visions in his sleep is constantly on red drugs that make him halucinate and drank poison from worms that make him halucinate even moreshort review all jokes aside this movie was spectacular with amazing storytelling and music that immerses you in this scifi fantazy world the most beautiful scenery and images in every scene and acting that just cant be complained about but the story suffers from poor character writing in some partssounds and soundtrack i saw the movie in the cinema with dolby surroundsound and it was one of the greatest experiences with sound i have had hans zimmer made a track that is unique and fitting the genre of scifi and the setting i will definitely check out the soundtrack laterstory and storytelling the story fit in extremely well with its precursor and very few if any bad kliches it was thought out thought provoking and emotionally provoking there was very little i thought could have been done differently pauls sudden change of heart regarding being leader felt dissatisfying as he had no inner conflict with his choices or embarassment towards chani the death of rabban i thought was too fast being done in only or moves with little to no emotional satisfaction the twist of the baron being his grandfather felt a little unasked for but if it plays a bigger role in the third installment it wont be a problem and lastly the death of feyd rautha i enjoyed austin butlers character enormesly and didnt like seeing him die but also think that his death was very well writin and epic i no longer see austin butler for his role as elvisthe pacing it felt very thought through and worked well on the big screen it really gave way for us to enjoy the stunning images without feeling forced though i wanted more of paul and chanis chemistry and a scene with paul telling her about his visions of her i think that would have shown their tight bond and make the ending even more heart crushingfinal rating alvin bladt yo,positive
550,i find myself perplexed by the casting choices in this film particularly the inclusion of christoffer walken and anna taylorjoy among others their presence in the movie felt incongruous to me and significantly impacted my viewing experience this sentiment echoes some of the other critiques ive come across where it was suggested that selecting individuals at random from a shopping mall might have yielded a more suitable cast moreover the pacing of the film left something to be desired as it could have been improved to enhance the overall narrative flow despite these criticisms its important to note that i did appreciate the movie overall the storyline cinematography and other aspects were engaging but the casting and pacing issues detracted from my full enjoyment and immersion in the film,positive
551,dune part had the weight of expectation upon its shoulders following the success of its predecessor however this highly anticipated sequel falls short of achieving the same level of excellence directed by denis villeneuve the film struggles with uneven pacing lackluster character development and a narrative that feels rushed and heavyhandedone of the glaring issues with dune part is its pacing which oscillates between dragging in the middle third and rushing through the final third the film spends too much time on inconsequential events leaving little room for character arcs to develop organically pauls transformation from a reluctant leader to a megalomaniac zealot feels particularly rushed and lacking in depth robbing the audience of the opportunity to truly empathize with his journey having attended a late evening showing there were times i was actually checking my watch unbelievably so but i have to admit myself bored particularly past the first hour markrather than feeling a drama play out in real time were simply told drama is playing out its a subtle but important difference but one which needs to be acknowledged unfortunately there is no sense of stakes here instead its just characters accomplishing one task after the other until paul can eventually become the messiah at no point did i ever feel this was under threat yet apparently according to what the characters are saying thats exactly how i should be feelinganother one of my main complaints was the love story between paul and chani with it feeling forced and clichd to the nth degree the lack of chemistry between the two actors was distracting and the onagain offagain nature of their romance detracted from the emotional weight their relationship is apparently supposed to carry its a narrative thread that weve seen countless times before yet done better in other movies leaving viewers feeling indifferent rather than invested i had no real reason to care about these two other than i was told i was supposed to by the plot we can call dune part a masterpiece all we want but when the main romance and arguably main backdrop of the second installment feels corny then we know weve got problemsthe introduction of austin butlers feydrautha character also feels unnecessary and cartoonish his role usurps that of dave bautistas beast rabban from the worldbuilding of the first film only to be disposed of by the end of the sequel this decision undermines the tension that could and probably should have been built with bautistas character and leaves audiences questioning the purpose of butlers inclusion feyd rautha felt evil for the sake of evil and a mere device to give the heros of paul and chani something to aim at whilst not actually threatening to alter the plotdespite these shortcomings dune part does have its strengths particularly in its visual effects framing and atmosphere denis villeneuve once again proves himself a master of his craft creating stunning visuals that transport audiences to the world of arrakis however these moments of visual brilliance can sometimes feel overindulgent with scenes of desert landscapes and thumpers dragging on for longer than necessary credit where credit is due howeverultimately dune part fails to deliver a satisfying payoff with the emperors defeat feeling anticlimactic and christopher walkens portrayal lacking the gravitas it deserves while the film runs for a lengthy time almost none of it is given towards developing his character and giving the audience a reason to care about his potential affect and inclusion in the narrative unfortunately he just exists here as a confused looking old man and the film is poorer for itin conclusion dune part is a visually impressive but a narratively underwhelming sequel while it may have been hailed as a masterpiece by some it ultimately fails to live up to its potential those seeking to immerse themselves in the world of dune would be better off sticking to the books as the film leaves much to be desired particularly given its lengthy runtime as a non book reader myself i sure know where ill be heading now to get my dune fix,negative
552,dune delivers an immersive cinematic experience that is truly unparalleled especially when viewed on the grand scale of imax from the breathtaking visuals to the mesmerizing music score every aspect of this film contributes to an unforgettable journey timothy chalamets portrayal of the central character is nothing short of remarkable showcasing his evolution from a reserved young man to a formidable warrior the plot unfolds seamlessly drawing viewers into a rich and intricate world where every detail is meticulously crafted overall dune is a cinematic masterpiece that more than justifies its presence on the big screen,positive
553,im not sure this is a masterpiece or a game changer this movie seems trapped in its own style it doesnt have the loose inhabitable vibe star wars has sorry to use this as a reference it might not be its setup but it feels rigidtake giedi prime for instance which seems like an action movie shot in a modern art museum with maybe coollooking but silly design choices like a black sun then there is an issue with the pacing theres lots of buildup but an unsatisfying wrapup with the sardaukar the way emotions are evoked like the way javier bardems character is meant to do at times feels forcedsome originally badass characters have poor resolutions and the action doesnt have the punch youd expect it to have some scenes look absolutely spectacular but overall its style over substance just not that engaging,negative
554,dune is no game of thrones i understand that but imagine how terrible it wouldve been if got was just a movies and battle of bstards was shown in minutes scene reverse it and imagine if dune was a tv show the romance between paul and chani were developed through episodes the acceptance of paul into the freman world were properly establisheda thrilling fight between paul and feyd and so many other things it couldve not only made total sense but also wouldve connected to the audience and done a justice to the storyas many people have said and in my opiniondunepart two is simply boring despite having the stunning visuals and amazing score denis villeneuve has put more focus on aesthetics than genuine storytelling and it does the real damage pacing of the movie is irregular where it tries to crammed lots of information in few scenes in the middle the ending is simply filling and unsatisfyingone big reason that it falls flat is because it tries to put few books worth of story into hm some die hard fans are pulling their hair thatas per the books it fails to describe the reasoning behind many things or its a wrong story and to the first time viewer it seems just another story of two sides fighting nothing moredepth in the story development of character arcs and suspense are the few things that could have make it great tvbut that requires time for thr story of this scale which couldve only done it by making it a show as a movie it feels rushed,positive
555,this is not your typical blockbuster vibe its not a simple remake of old movies or lets says a marvel movie not that dont like those kind of movies but in my way i always classifying movie in the different familly one for the movie that are for fun that distract me marvel mcu did great for that here denis villeneuve put his dream into screen to share is fabulous interpratation of the book the story the costume the soundtrack the actors the colors and the picture are all epic i love kubric movie for the same kind of reason im glad the the box office relate to that i think i will reread the books before third part,positive
556,this film has potential to be one the greatest movies of all time words can hardly describe what this movie made me feel with every big fight scene you can feel everything the loud pounding of gunshots the heavy clanking of swords and knifes smashing against one another and with the small handtohand fights you can feel the emotion every punch kick stab all of it the acting was absolutely phenomenal unlike any ive ever seen beforetimothe chalamet deserve all the praise he is about to gain from this film this has to be chalamets best performance yet along with many others while not his best performance austin butler absolutely delivers in this movie as feyd rautha not quite living up to antagonist performances such as heath ledgers joker in nolans dark knight or costar javier bardem in no country for old men however he is absolutely on the new list of film antagonist amongst others such as josh brolin rebecca ferguson and zendaya this movie is packed with the greatest performances ive witnessed in a scifi filmgreig fraser oh lord where do i even begin this films cinematography was absolutely stupendous id put this movies cinematography on par with such works like linus sandgren in la la land and roger deakins in this movie has the masterful blend of color angles and framing everything about this movies cinematography set the tones perfectly and im one hundred percent here for itoverall this has got to be one of the greatest movies ive ever seen and id recommend to anybody no matter your taste in films,positive
557,awesome stunning the film follows through the spirit of the books with the everpresent internal turmoil of paul it has the feel of mysticism of the books the cinematography is spectacular and so is hans zimmers music the freemen and harkons are depicted really well and so is the planet dune at the same time there are many details and happenings left behind so for people who have not read the books its a bit difficult to follow the narrative the movie doesnt follow thoroughly the destiny of the other of the closest friends and servents of the duke who survived the massacre in part,positive
558,dune part is a masterclass in filmmaking skilfully directed by denis villeneuve who effortlessly brings frank herberts complex universe to life the storytelling is a brilliant tapestry of intrigue seamlessly blending intricate plotlines and character arcsthe cinematography is a visual feast with sweeping desert landscapes and aweinspiring set pieces that transport the audience to arrakis itself the ensemble cast led by stellar performances from timothee chalamet and zendaya breathes life into each character creating a captivating onscreen chemistryfurthermore the music score composed by hans zimmer elevates the entire experience perfectly complementing the grandeur of the narrativedune part is a cinematic triumph a symphony of talent converging to deliver a truly unforgettable masterpiece,positive
559,just watched on imax this afternoon this is a whole new level of filmmaking much better than the first one and im a huge fan of part one the characters music visuals everything single thing is incredibly crafted you can actually feel the other worldly characters and stories heck you can even believe that paul is a godly figure and not oh yeah he did it cos hes the chosen one when the time camesure they changed more stuff than they did with part one but as a book fan the changes are very well suited for on screen audience and make more sense even the only complaint i have is that i cant get enough of it i need more we need part three,positive
560,the storyline of this film deserves lots of praise and thatvus just the beginning the cinematography is fantastic it actually brings one into the world of arrakis the movie shows how belief is the biggest weapon humanity can wield and also the scariest if used inappropriately the acting from timothe is fantastic you really see him grow into this character the lisan algaib there were a few acting performances that did not hit par but on the whole this is a mega movie and a true boxoffice beast i do wonder whether the oscars would try and allow this big budget blockbusters play a more prominent role in awards season,positive
561,the film looks great sounds great and generally delivers on the payoffs set up in the first film however the magic of arrakis and the depth of all characters seem to be missing entirelythe worms are reduced to transport and war machines with no explanation of their relationship with spice and shown so often their visual impact is nonexistent by the endno discussion of bringing water to the desert or the fremens devotion to making the land habitable reducing the fremen to an army of worshippers for paul whos only purpose is to choose whether or not to believe in himwe already knew from the first movie that paul would be the messiah there was plenty of time to flesh out other characters and with everything else that was ignored that should have been the focus instead the film was more concerned with getting from one action setpiece to the next without much thought given to why or how this leaves many scenes and character actions feeling disjointed or confusing gone is the internal logic of the story replaced with raw justification for spectacle the lore of the world is not expanded instead it somehow shrinks as characters are killed off or have their agency stripped away for the sake of the plot with the only real new information being about the water of life which is poorly explained with its relationship to spice and the worms not to mention jessicas unborn daughtertoo much wasted time for such a long film i would normally be more generous and give it a but this is far from the perfect movie its being praised to be and even farther from a perfect science fiction movie,positive
562,dune part two is the greatest example of why movie theaters will never die going to the theaters and seeing a movie is an event and it should be entertaining and enjoyable enough to leave a lasting impact dune part two does exactly this in a runtime that would be considered long but never once slows down or loses its quality the main cast in this film in excellentchalamet ferguson zendaya and butler deliver toptier performances that i believe will get their own recognition at next years academy awardsvilleneuve has already proven to be a fantastic director but i think he has the chance to be the greatest science fiction director of all time with films like this and part one the arrival and blade runner i think its safe to say we are in great hands and hopefully the content of the dune saga will only grow and i trust villeneuve to deliver another excellent picture with dune messiah and his next couple of filmsif you havent seen this movie yet please do yourself the favor of seeing it on the biggest possible screen you can with the best sound it really enhances the film and its visuals score and sound without movie theaters we would never get films as grand and epic as this one is and i dont think anyone should miss out on the opportunity to see this adaptation of frank herberts magnum opus,positive
563,dune part two or they fly now they fly nowwell that was less than compelling i liked part one enough to watch it twice by the end of this one i was so sick of light brown i was craving a blueberry i have a lot more to say about it than i want to put here now little of it good but ill try to keep it shortlots of miscasting imo zendaya spends most of the film glaring and looking over her shoulder seriously her flat midwestern accent was terrifically out of place in the midst of all the other fremen austin butler looks down and to the side like he does in every other performance i just saw him doing nothing but in the dead dont die christopher walken was a great dramatic actor but i can only see him as a joke nowfine visual effects but far too long getting to them lots of people just looking i thought maybe spielberg directed it for a while this movie really made me hate sand its coarse and rough and gets everywherei dont know if the book ended there but the movie ending seemed rather abrupt,positive
564,i honestly dont know which movie these people have watched but it cannot be dune part twothis movie was ponderously boring the riding the worms scenes were laughable minute creatures on gigantic worms supposedly able to control them with paperclip hooks and cotton thread i dont think so the scale just looked daftcasting christopher walken as the emperor was a mistake and did not work at all what a miscast that was i cant say i connected to any of the characters and it was frustrating because i wanted this movie to be epic as it was id rather have spent a night letting my girlfriend pull nostril hairs out of my nose at least it would have had tears tension intense emotion laughter and reliefi cant really be bothered to do a full review ive given it stars because of the cgi,negative
565,its up to the people who love good movies to get out to the theaters when they make a movie like this i grew up watching dune on tv at least a dozen times i think it did more with less but this movie is on all fronts much better and deserves my highest rating it wasnt perfect but when you spend almost hours in a theater and never once want to leave your seat we had people in our group and everyone loved it so that is another reason for the ages male and female ive never read the books so i cant critique from that point of view but after watching part now i want to order the books and hopefully refrain from reading the last one until after part is released,positive
566,the perfect sequel to the first movie i have seen this movie at imax as denis villeneuve said is made for the pacing in this movie is perfect you are not rushed in the story there are no breaks in the narrative of the story it is very easy to understand to pick up and to relate to the story the sound the cinematography the special effects are something out of this planet it was the first time for me in years of going to the cinema and feeling amazed about everything it was a shock good movies still exist hollywood just need to leave creative people do their thing the soundtrack by hans zimmer makes the experience even more immersive you feel like you are there in conclusion this is the movie of the decade i do not think it will be something else to beat this,positive
567,this movie is an absolute amazing masterpiece of a movie continuing right after dune part one it is a great continuation of a young man named paul who is destined to be a leader of not just his birthright but a leader of many other people i this movie he slowly learns the ways of the sand people and takes his place as the leader of the people and during this process also finds a person who he loves and has a little twist in there relationship near the end of the film i think this movie is full of great detail a great story and fantastic actors highly recommend this film worth seeing in theatres and if not in theatres a great home movie buy for movie night,positive
568,top notch movie i have ever experienced must try it in imax musicdirection cinematography visuals acting everything is so good that you cant take eye from the screen this is a reference for the best movie each and every shots were like beautiful picture and the sounds will give you goosebumps every time i dont know how many times i got these feelings imax theaterical experience is also another factor fight sequence were felt real and good effort from the actor sideits a love action drama music meditating movie you will be fully satisfied at the end and expecting a sequence must try everyone,positive
569,soooo epic religion love drama and war everything ist in it and on an epic scale the pictures are stunning and the music breathtaking ist futuristic and on the other hand also very basic and the story itself could also play in the middle age the main thema are timeless and very interesting the characters and the the artists playing them are amazing and very deep ist mystic and from an other world but yet it picks up themes we know all to well from our everyday life watched it in imax and it was the best cinema experience in a long long times it for sure is a and i would recommend it to everyone,positive
570,fully loaded with testosterone incredibly impressive when i watched the first episode i said it sounded like a star wars series and i saw that i was absolutely right in the nd episode it seems like it will be a series as enjoyable as star wars thank god the cast the costumes the scenes are as if designed by another being it makes you think that it cannot be a human being who made this film i hope part will be filmed very soon and will meet with the audience as soon as possible i hope part will be filmed very soon and will meet with the audience as soon as possibleya iste gzel film,positive
571,i find that if youre a fan of the series and love it then you will like the sequel i however not a normal dune fan but liked part one i found part really long and way too much dialogue since they explained character in part one and austin butlers character made no sense but the special effects and acting were phenomenal unfortunately it was kind of a sleeper movie where i almost fell asleep due to non action and due to overdoing the story line it could of been done in hours all the acti g again and cgi was amazingthe ending didnt make sense but set it up for a possible third movie,positive
572,director denis villeneuves dune part picks up the narrative threads seamlessly from where its predecessor left off delivering another visually stunning and emotionally resonant chapter in frank herberts legendary sagafrom the mesmerizing landscapes of arrakis to the intricate political webs woven among its inhabitants villeneuve masterfully captures the essence of herberts richly imagined universe the films visuals once again are nothing short of breathtaking with sweeping desert vistas and intricately designed spacecraft that transport viewers to the heart of this expansive worldtimothe chalamets portrayal of paul atreides continues to impress as he navigates the treacherous waters of power and destiny with a maturity beyond his years his chemistry with rebecca ferguson who shines once again as the fierce and enigmatic lady jessica adds depth to their complex motherson relationshipnewcomers to the cast including zendaya as the mysterious fremen warrior chani and javier bardem as the charismatic stilgar breathe life into their respective roles bringing a fresh energy to the ensembleone of the films greatest strengths lies in its ability to balance grand spectacle with intimate character moments while the epic scale of the story is undeniably aweinspiring it is the human drama at its core that truly resonates themes of identity loyalty and sacrifice are explored with nuance and depth inviting audiences to ponder the complexities of power and the nature of destinyhans zimmers haunting score once again elevates the film perfectly complementing the grandeur and emotion of the narrative his use of leitmotifs and sonic textures adds layers of meaning to each scene immersing viewers in the world of dune in ways both subtle and profoundthe second installment of denis villeneuves dune saga not only builds upon the foundation laid by its predecessor but also delves deeper into the intricate politics and ideologies that shape the universe of arrakis as the power struggles between the noble houses intensify and the specter of war looms ever larger the film navigates the murky waters of ambition and betrayal with deft precisionone of the films most striking aspects is its attention to detail both in its worldbuilding and character development from the intricacies of fremen culture to the machiavellian machinations of the various factions vying for control of arrakis every aspect of herberts universe is brought to vivid life on the screen each character no matter how minor feels fully realized with their own motivations and desires driving the narrative forwardthe cinematography once again deserves special mention for its ability to capture the otherworldly beauty of arrakis while also conveying the harsh realities of life on the desert planet from the towering sand dunes to the windswept sietches of the fremen every frame is a visual feast for the eyes immersing viewers in a world that is at once alien and familiarat the heart of the film lies the character of paul atreides whose journey from reluctant heir to messianic figure is at once epic and deeply personal timothe chalamets portrayal is nothing short of mesmerizing capturing the internal struggle and external pressures that define pauls transformation with remarkable nuance and subtletythe supporting cast too deserves praise for their performances with each actor bringing their own unique talents to their respective roles from oscar isaacs stoic portrayal of duke leto atreides to jason momoas charismatic turn as duncan idaho every member of the ensemble contributes to the films success adding layers of complexity to an already rich tapestry of charactersof course no discussion of dune part would be complete without mentioning the films thematic depth at its core dune is a story about power who wields it who seeks it and who ultimately pays the price for its pursuit through its exploration of themes such as colonialism environmentalism and the nature of prophecy the film invites audiences to reflect on the timeless questions of ethics and morality that lie at the heart of human existencein conclusion dune part is a triumph of both storytelling and spectacle a rare cinematic experience that manages to be both epic in scope and intimate in its emotional resonance with its stunning visuals compelling performances and thoughtprovoking themes it stands as a testament to the power of cinema to transport us to worlds beyond our imagination while also challenging us to confront the truths that lie at the heart of our own humanity,positive
573,this movie is too long to the point where much of it is boring the story advancement could have easily been covered in hrs the extra mins is just boring drawn out scenes that add no value that should have been included in an extended version as a result i found myself not engaged in the story and turned if off several times coming back to it to finish it over days really ruined the experience for me there are just so many scenes of people looking out over sand dunes and blowing sand that one can stand i know the diehard fans are all going to rate this as a because theyve waited so long for an epic but imo this is a good story ruined with too much fluff,negative
574,i went in blind aware of the hype and praise but giving it a fair chancefirst of all there are some great scenes no doubt the first minutes were pretty goodhowever it is simply too long too long means it gets boring and monotonous and like some astute critics have said the problem of it lingers in the question of why should i care sure there are religious and political elements that carry truth but ultimately they come across as clichebasically you have a quasi biblical savior story here i guess you can just compare it to neo in the matrix with his journey of being the one the savior the problem is weve seen it all beforeas much as i was immersed in the visuals and interesting and grand visual scenes by the one hour point u couldnt help but to check my watch and how much time was left then it picked up again for fifteen minutes before becoming boring againthis will suffice as a sci fi experience and i can see fans of the book loving it maybe but it just lost me about halfway through i wont deny the reviews and arguments that say part i was probably bettermasterpiece certain scenes scattered about it were but overall it is just too long and needs serious editing to be a true one,positive
575,the visuals through the entire film were stunning the characters development was masterful and the casting couldnt be more perfect with performances from all of them the best scifi film ive ever seen without a shadow of a doubt the cinematic genius from denis allows for a vast understanding of the planet the introduction of the emperor and the five house perfectly sets up the next film which im sure will be action packed and will further develop paul and his mothers character along with the introduction of his sister who will certainly be an extremely impactful character truly the perfect movie,positive
576,this is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice just by talking about it it is the kind of experience you had once but you never thought you would get again until this movie proves you wrongthis movie take the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of all timeeverything in this movie was top notch dennis villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of scifi movies but just filmmaking in general this was a demonstration of power in what you can achieve with filmmakingi beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find this will be an experience that will stick with you foreveri though real blockbuster was dead but i was wrong this is the cinematic experience i cravednow i am gonna watch this movie again and again and again then i am possibly gonna read the books,positive
577,best film i have ever seen simple the plot behind this story from both films are truly astonishing the most beautiful part though is how denis villeneuve brings this movie to life it was his dream project and you can truly see that in the way made this film its just so good the little attention to details and paul fulfilling his destiny then becoming the man he was meant to be compared to the boy in this fist filmhans zimmer i mean wow i have no words i am speechless the music behind this film is hand down his best ever work you really feel immersed in to the story you really feel like this movie is set in a different universe,positive
578,drove km to watch this movie on imax it was totally worth it get to the biggest screen possibleyou would be mesmerized by the visuals and music and would just sit back and let them wash over you alongside you have brilliant cast who give their besti wish feudreutha the emporer and his daughter characters are more fleshed out denis shows why he is one of the best directors of our generation his world building if flawless and he was true to the books with very minor deviationsi hope everyone catches this on big screen we dont get pure artistic movies like this made with such passion,positive
579,for a movie that is dangerously close to hours i am impressed by how quickly it went by the plot was consistently moving ahead but laced with lovely moments of quiet and stillness it was visually a masterpiece beautiful scenery detailed costumes grand scale wide shots and tons of tiny details in my opinion the acting and casting were spot on all around i liked the scenes from the emperorprincess it was a great way to show those parts of the bookthe reason for the missing star and the spoiler part of my review is that very jarring confusing editing choice early on where paul is sent off on a test mission but then for some reason chani is with him all the sudden and then people ate around the plot kept going but the trial never ended i thought i fell asleep or blacked out or something and although i was never bored in the end it felt both too slow and too fast somehow but those nitpicky complaints aside amazing,positive
580,its been a minute since weve seen big screen fullmealdeal science fiction and dune part two tries to deliver with sweeping special effects and a very large canvass this film does its best to check the boxes created when the star wars franchise was at its zenithbut as the cgi glitz and earpiercing sound fade what remains is lessthansatisfying dialogue and the shopworn plot lines of little guy fights against inestimable odds and will two lovers find a waycasting is uneven rebecca fergusons screenscorching sensuality is barely recognizable and wasted here but the amiable austin butler transforms well from his turn as a sympathyevoking elvis into a cheerfully efficient serial killer once again javier bardem steals scene after scene with his comically touching portrayal of destinys true believerdespite its flaws this film still entertains perhaps because were so starved for the genre that were more forgiving than the sand wormsbut truly if youre going allin on a megaproduction such as dune two give a thought to the screenplay as theatre attendance strives for a postcovid comeback the redefinition of an epic film will need to include more crisp dialogue and a tighter plot line,positive
581,there are very few perfect movies the goonies top gun maverick a goofy movie to name a few this movie was a if there ever was one perfection is the only word i can use to accurately describe it truly a mustsee in imax from beginning to end this movie will pull you in and refuse to let go whether you are new to the world of dune or experienced and well versed in the lore this movie is for you the visuals are stunning the sound fx are brilliant the acting superb if this is what hollywood is capable of doing then i will expect more masterpieces like this one in the future the spice must flow,positive
582,let me start by saying i think this is an excellent film but im as conflicted as i am impressedrather than being the second half of the book adaptation of dune this brings in more of the ideological analysis and political power play that exist across the galaxy the bulk of this mightve been influenced by dune messiah but the roles are impacted changed squandered enhanced and fleshed outfor a long film less book plot transpires from dune the film is asking for a part but may have lost a good portion of its fan base with just how far dv has departed or abandoned aspects of the booksno longer are we given a visual or narrated insight into pauls insight and visions of the past present and futurehis sister remains unborn add therefore her character is developed as a sentient foetus the victory of taking back arrakis is swift despite easily taking the entire runtime of the whole of david lynchs film and giving us more of a sense of her power and precociousness her life as as the dukes daughter and something more is denied in this representation and chani is transformed to the opposite of her character in the book for me this choice to empower chanis stance to one of understanding beyond her books character means we lost seeing her wisdom and belief with the time dedicated her relationship with paul is left estranged rather than a deep believer there was time to develop other characters to portray this revisionism and it is largely borrow from the second novel dune messiah exploring how the bene gesserates seed prophetic stories and female children to manipulate and control the houses and the reach of their power over generations and more no montage and voice over used or needed but the passage of time felt long enough to introduce and develop pauls sister she is missed most in the last act while chani becomes the voice of decent josh brolin as gurney becomes sycophantic almostthe choices fit our current world tensions somewhat but dv withholds enough of the book to justify a third film too much in my opinion to make this a satisfying filmnone book readerslisteners and fans will feel short changed from two films of this running time there was easily more to develop and conclude and allow for multiple more films this feels more like a bargaining tool with wb for a franchiseif the internal voice was silenced from paul it also distances him from the audience he is less noble and more vengeful and the final act seems hurried with critical fights less impressive and certain kills given to the protagonistso i am finding this a mixed bag with david lynch giving more accuracy and conclusion of the books narrative however in hollywood money is made in retention and sequels dv now has a divergent version of dune to bring around the book spawned several official sequels and this could be the money maker that saves wbthe visuals and large scale action is original and bold glorious acting by all save emperor walken no gravitas or strategic brilliance on display i found this weak casting austin butler surprised mei felt that the harkonnen perverse natures was underplayed partly because since the book was written homosexuality is not the nonacceptable sensibility it was in frank herberts time also i feel that hollywood wants money to roll in from countries where representation of such meets censorshipthe cinematography and the restraint shown with the worms really pay off if i had not read the books i think this would be up there as a that i gave the more promising and faithful part one so if part now happens and works better for these choices as the plot and character arcs continue then this might deserve more praiseas it stands this may have undermined the book fanbase but gained modern audience satisfaction could chani be a willing and understanding concubine knowing she would be his true love but accept a political marriage in this day and ageit certainly leaves lots to be discussed and hopefully more to be seen i truly hope this is successful and i understand the posture i cant help but feel two films was sufficient for dune frank herbert it could be argued had to write messiah to capitalise on his own success and to bridge and retrofit dune to enable children of dune this way perhaps dv has positioned himself more strategically does he have the stamina for the journey to continue i hope the answer is a yes from legendary and wb,positive
583,less than of earths human population will agree with me you are all going to think i am a weak stupid panzee who needs to shut up there are two main problems with this movie the message and the violencethe message says fight and kill at all costs to preserve yourself slaughter and humiliate your enemies use peoples beliefs to control them and be a good leader by ruling through fear in the dune universe it is the year humans and humanoids have still not learned to work together the movie is a great representation of todays world with all the kingdoms of the earth deceiving and fighting one another trying to be the king of the hill even if the rest of the world must suffer except in the movie it is just more brutal and barbaric than the slow politics of todays worldunfortunately because of the big name actors and all the money made to promote the film its critically acclaimed back when i was a teenager i would have loved this movie but i now i have come to learn that violence and country nationalism is preventing us from actually making the world a better placei could go on but no one is reading this far into my review,positive
584,christopher nolan described the film as denis the empire strikes back and once you see the film you understand why its an absolute cinematic masterpiece a film that stuns you with its cinematography gives you goosebumps with its music and leaves you in awe with its performancesdenis villeneuves filmography and how it gets better with every film is simply remarkable and probably hes got the best one yet with dune part two his sense of direction and his vision for the film and franchise is beyond anything and it shows you can see the grandiosity and yet the stillness in so many of the scenesthe story for those who arent aware keeps getting bigger as it progresses and the film keeps levelling up the silence is golden because then the shots can speak more than the dialogue there are also scenes which amp you up like nothing elsealongside that ride is grieg fraser with the best cinematography you can see on the big screen especially the imax screen every frame is a treat to watch the details the scenes everything theres no small or big scene here everything is a cinematic experience the still scenes and the magnanimous momentstimothee chalamet is showcasing his best work here and we arent talking about it enough already theres a stillness and stoicism in his performance but also ferocity and hunger the combination of elements that bring out the best of him on the screen and elevate his performancewhile zendayas role seemed more of a supporting one rather than a lead one it is an important role where much of her performance is through her eyes more than anything else and theres so much power in thatyou cannot talk about dune part two and not talk about rebecca ferguson her command over her character and the powerpacked performance she has delivered youre in awe every time shes on screenjavier bardem florence pugh christopher walken and josh brolin are all exceptional but theres another standout name that yet again delivers brilliantly austin butler what a scenestealer his voice his look his personality a fiery role in this already exceptional castthe impact dune part two makes is incomplete without the music of hans zimmer literal goosebumps are what youre able to feel the elevation that it brings to the scenes and how youre able to feel whats about to come only with the music is extraordinarythere are some films when you say this is cinema and this is one of them in such instances even if there are a few flaws here and there you dont want to notice them when everything else is so good and so many elements are appreciable at such high capacity you cannot watch this film just once,positive
585,dune is as good as an adaptation in film form can be casting acting world building sound cinematography everything is greattimothe chalamet and rebecca ferguson are the stars of the show and both perfectly deliver the transition to manipulative unsympathetic characters compared to the first one where they are victims of betrayal and you feel for their loss in this one you only feel sympathy for them until you realize the only reason is knowing the harkonnen are so much worse paul is not a hero something the first movie didnt make clearthe rest of the cast is great javier bardem josh brolin and stellan skarsgard are great as usual dave bautista has surprising range and seems to do his best work with villeneuve on the helm im seeing a lot of praise for austin butler and his performance was good but not anything extraordinary his character is a psychopath and doesnt leave much room for subtlety zendaya is good but in the beginning it feels like shes replaying her character from spider man she has only two modes annoyed and concerned she does much better on the second half christopher walken is great obviously but it was distracting to cast such a wellknown actor as a character that wasnt even shown before and who is very reserved and secluded by the very nature of his rolethe movie is almost hours long and it didnt feel that much but it had some minor pacing issues it feels rushed at some points and i think it lacked some transition scenes for instance i wanted to see more transitions with spaceships in space like we see once in the first one they make the vast distances between planets clearer and increase the sense of isolation and remoteness of arrakis the movie doesnt really feel like an interplanetary epic it feels like everything is happening very closei wish the role of spice was made clearer in the first one and it wasnt so i was expecting that in this one and i was disappointed it was overlooked again without showing the navigators their role and the transformations they go through the spice feels more like a mcguffin than an integral part of the plot im not a fan of the books but i know the navigators are really introduced only in messiah however i think having an earlier hint of their role and the real importance of spice would make the stakes clearer specially when we see pauls visions about the future and his decision to go through with it knowing what will happenoverall its few minor flaws are due to things that are missing and im sure villeneuve had to make many hard decisions about what to leave out of the movie to keep the runtime reasonable,positive
586,dune part two was a perfect sequel to villeneuves first part he accomplished all of the books major plot points while also delivering stunning performances and visuals a fantastic execution of unexpected humor with a passionate performance from javier bardemmost films in recent years only dream of having the brilliance of this film and much of that is due to the director of photography greig fraser one of the best this film will be remembered as one of the ziggurats of modern science fiction and deserves all the laurels it will receiveit hasnt been long since a franchise and a singular film captivated and demonstrated so much passion pouring onto the screen this story these characters this planet dune comes to fight for its place in the history of science fiction cinema its a disservice to the sound and photography experience not to see this film in imax you feel part of each scenefantastic filmzendaya is a true actress,positive
587,the story are the movie let time to explain every detail the actors was picked perfect and we not talk about the acting performance the transition from story to actionwar the music from hans zimmer combine perfect with movie scenes the script was extremely well written and perfectly thought through its have a very very good story has a good action and has a little bit romantic but not much when you watch this movie you feel every scene with emotional finally my opinion are a because it has every think in it for example it has action a little bit romantic and the story takes time from dune to dune,positive
588,absolutely mesmerising from start to finish a masterclass in storytelling and a visual spectacle dune part was executed to perfection and is a love letter to the fans whove read the book along with the people who havent i strongly suggest reading the book as villeneuve leaves a lot unsaid a lot of internal monologue within the book all while implying it through the actions of the characters and as someone who has read the book it was so wonderful to experience that the film itself is truly beautiful heartbreaking and full of lessons within lessons that give a true insight into the struggles of people in our world i think the film truly encapsulates the idea of there are no sides that the books tried so hard to impart thank you denis villeneuve for bringing a story i loved so much to life in the most spectacular fashion,positive
589,no doubt this is one of the greatest sci fi movie ever it just surpasses its predecessor with ease its more deep and amazing it is more character driven story with great character development of paul atriedis with chani more in the story its scifi political relegious all mix into one masterpiece this film has taken me over with its greatness along with beautiful cinematography and design all the characters have great presence inside the narrative the movies pacing is so great as it does not feels bored or stretched pauls character change is really good how be becomes a great deal in the movie,positive
590,like the first film of this two part adaptation of frank heberts scifi classic dune part two was a very mixed bag for me on a technical level its brilliant easily one of the best looking films of this century if nothing else director denis villeneuve sure knows how to shoot a movie i just wish he were better at telling a storyhis blade runner was also gorgeous but it suffered from being cold soulless and without any real sense of purpose unlike the latter dune part two has a purpose thanks to whatever is left here from frank herberts vision but it also lacks any semblance of emotion or genuine humanity it somehow manages to be both epic and flat quite a feat but not one to be proud ofthe film is also tragically miscast timothe chalamet finally starts to rise to the occasion in fits and starts once he becomes the one but everyone besides rebecca ferguson and javier bardem are just dreadful enough cant be said about how awful zendaya is here even in her wheelhouse she has the range of a spitball but shes in way way over her skis on this one and dont get me started on christopher walken as the emperor christopher walken are you kidding me this needed an actor with some gravitas and regality walken feels far too contemporary for this sort of thinglook dune is my favorite novel of alltime and my cool reaction to the first part of this adaptation is why it took me nearly six months to watch this its not the changes that bother me save for the ending with chani which is an unforgivable sin in my opinion its that this whole thing ends up feeling like a pretentious preening bore instead of the grand spectacle space opera it should have been,positive
591,long live the fightersthis film being a masterpiece is simply an understatement its practically perfect i genuinely have not a single critique that i can think of this is the best experience with a film i probably have ever hadim going to split this up into two parts the first without spoilers and the second half will contain some pretty big spoilers that i need to addressspoiler freewhere do i even begin from the very beginning scene you can tell this is going to be phenomenal if you liked dune at least a faint bit you will most likely love this everything from the first film is elevated tenfold you can feel the amount of pure passion and love that denis villeneuve and the entire crew poured onto this behemoth of a project easily another oscar sweep for dune this time itll most likely win best picture because i cant fathom another film getting this close to perfection ever again or at least in the near future visually unexplainably beautiful if you get the chance you need to watch it in imax or just the largest screen and loudest speakers you possibly can the black and white feydrautha sequence is edited to unfathomable levels of perfection hell thats just one of the scenes i can say that for this movie has at least ten of the most badass shots ive ever seen hans zimmers score is crafted with his usual mastery and is complimented so greatly by greig frasers visuals in a beautiful tango of sight and soundthe conflicts our characters face are so intriguing and immersive that we understand what theyre going through the dire decisions they have to make and what it will cost them the commentary on faith purpose and what is too far its so much more than a pretty scifilm movie with cool sounds there is so much soul and so much to say and it executes every beat it wants to hit without fail from giant epic battles to deep personal emotional and quiet conversations it all blends as one beautiful portrait that is easily denis viellenueves magnum opusthe entire cast bodies every roll timothee chalamet is the perfect paul atreides he handles his character with such power and gives off this aura that i havent seen in a very long time may be the best character ever written that ive seen if you dont care about this film at all thats okay but please watch it to see his performance at least austin butlers feydrautha is even more menacing than he is in the books and again is transformed into a performance i could see getting him another oscar nomination rebecca fergusons lady jessica has this presence that i cant even put into words zendayas chani has this beautiful chemistry with chalamets paul atreides with an irreplicable story between them so greatly displayedi loved the costume design accompanied by some spectacular lighting that compliments each other in a way i havent seen anything close to itthis is absolute scifi perfection this is tied or even surpasses empire as the best scifi film of all time and is the easiest top four i have ever put on this account and it wont leave thats for sure every person who worked on this is a master at their craft and will be remembered throughout history as the people who put together potentially the greatest story ever told i heard all the praise that this film got and knew after reading the book that it was going to be easily one of my favorites but nothing could have prepared me for it to be as good as it was genuinely cannot think of a complaint i commented on the first dune how i wish there was an extended edition not needed anymore denis villeneuve couldnt have done better he elevated the emotion and intensity of everything that happens in the novel with numerous additions to the source material while still being perfectly faithful the only thing that saddens me is that frank herbert himself couldnt have watched this i just know this is exactly what he wanted and what he deserved for his masterpiece of a noveli cant express what this movie means to me ill be rewatching it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again ive thrown around the phrase this is my empire strikes back a few times like when i watched endgame for example but this is truly the only film that is deserving of that phrase im so thankful i had the opportunity to see it all unfold in imax with a packed theater of pure dune fans it felt like homelong live cinemaspoilers they gave gurney his baliset i genuinely got so excited that he got his few seconds with it denis adaptation is so faithful to the source material while still having some insane creative liberties that for the first time outside of his first dune just increases the qualityi loved what he did with princess irulan where we got to see her actually record the excerpts we read at the beginning of every chapter such a great detail that lets us dive deeper into her character that barely makes an appearance in the actual book actually denis villeneuve does a wonderful job of extending the appearances of all these characters that werent in the novel in the first place we get so much rabban which makes me so happy i was wishing we had gotten more of him in the first film because hes a pretty important character who we dont see much action from already in the book so us being able to see him at his fullest during this was great i cant even begin to talk about feydrautha what a character his presence is only matched by muaddib himself who i will get to shortly hes so menacing and evil i love him getting to see him just slash people for simply questioning him was awesome and im so glad we got to see even more parallels between him and muaddib especially the added gom jabbar that i dont recall being a part of the novel hell of his scenes werent in the novel but are all so in character and perfectly done that its as if it was all a part of the original writingpaul atreides muaddib usul kwisatz harderach lisanal whatever you want to call him is easily one of the best characters ever put onto screen ive said it already a few times but the aura that chalamet brings to this character is something i cant put into words and is something that needs to be experienced the shift in his character as we see him slowly accept his terrible purpose is so brilliantly displayed the expressions in his eyes the way he presents himself all of it changes ever so slightly as we see him being the one i remember after reading the book i revisited dune and was lost on why they left out the revelation that the baron is lady jessicas father pauls grandfather i remember thinking that this movie was gonna be half flashbacks because of scenarios like that and was slightly worried i will never put an ounce of doubt on villeneuve ever again the way that its revealed is so well done that it was another one of those moments where youd think that it was written like that originally pauls conflict is so well displayed i loved seeing the really dark undertones that he was showing as the film progressed realizing that this war is a necessary thing to happen and no matter what that throne has to be taken its exactly what frank herbert would have wanted after he had to make an entire second book just because everyone thought paul was a perfect hero denis handled that misconception perfectly and i cant wait for dune messiah god please let it be greenlit to see him fully handle the aftermath that means im going to be reading dune messiah asapi thought the choice of alia not being born and no real mention of leto ii was very interesting but definitely didnt take anything away from the film it definitely would be weird and difficult to have a fouryearold act like an allknowing bene gesserit woman i love how it also allowed for the chance of paul killing the baron himself which in my opinion was much more satisfying than alia doing it speaking of satisfying death i loved how gurney was the one who was able to kill rabban after he mentioned that he killed his family as well as gave him the scar on his face much much more satisfying lady jessica talking to alia with her still in the womb i thought was really cool and perfectly displayed the connection the bene gesserit have with each other as well as a cool nod to the motherdaughter bondevery battle especially the final one has so much raw emotion and strength with this scale that cannot be matched i was grinning from ear to ear so much that i wish i had a camera set on me throughout the whole thing the atreides banner being waved on top of sandworms is one of the coolest things ill ever see the feydrautha birthday gladiator fight is one of the coolest things ill ever see the final battle between muaddib and feydrautha is one of the coolest things ill ever see the worldbuilding as we dive further into arrakis and giedi prime is one of the coolest things ill ever see the conflicts between bene gesserit fremen atreides harkonnen sardaukar and guild is one of the coolest things ill ever seei could type for years but i need to just let this soak for a bit ill be writing more with every watch of this i have,positive
592,ive read the original book several times and have seen the movie both versions and the syfy channel miniseries while both missed something it wasnt as bad as accelerating the timeliness and leaving out key scenes that would make a third movie dune messiah more plausible such as in previous versions alia pauls sister was the one to kill vladimir harkonen this is what lead to her eventual insanity as was shown in the syfy channels children of dune the cinematography of the movie was great but splitting the fremen like how islam is split was a poor choice the choice to make the fremen of two sects might have been a good way to go given how religious sects go but in my opinion it was the wrong way to go and making paul and even more reluctant hero also weakened the movie the quickening of the timeliness was foolish because in the book and previous versions it took time for paul to learn what he needed to learn and for the love between paul and chani to develop if this had been done properly then the story would have been better,positive
593,i dont understand all the hype its boring bland it doesnt catch on at all like the first part too much indifferent dialog you end up checking your smartphone doesnt capture the franchise at all im a fan of dune the books the games and the movies but dune part should have been made completely differently total waste of time and very disappointing the plot and the acting are far from what you would have expected its just not worth the time you spend watching this utter trash its in fact a taunt to the entire franchise what s huge dissapointment avoid and save your time and money,negative
594,a really accurate representation of the book although there are some changed elements still an amazing film the portrayal of the harkonnens is breathtaking the music and the effects are exhiliraring and the lead actors play impeccably well especially timothy seeing as movies today often do not tell the whole story as it should be told i would say that this film almost perfectly envisions how a book adaptation should be made moreover the visual effects are stunning the sandworms are depicted perfectly and the use of more practical effects over cgi is something that todays cinema lacks which this films executes perfectly,positive
595,one of those rare movies that takes you into the world it portraysabsolutly amazing cast effects storytelling and pacei hear alot of critic that its really slow in st of movie and thats a lie movie starts real fast and never looms back personaly ausitn butler stole the show but in movie this good its so hard just to take one component i knew the story i red the book i seen the old lync movie and still this one went over all my expectationsdenis thank you for this amazing work this is true labor of love this is how you do justice to source material now long wait for rd one,positive
596,dune part is one of the best movies i have ever seen the first movie was also good but i gave it an i give this movie a timothe chalamets acting reaches its peak with this movie the performances of the other actors were also good but one of them captivated me i would even put rebecca fergusons performance ahead of timothe chalamet she was simply mesmerizing theres not much more to say because everything is obvious its a perfect movie towards the end of the movie my smart wristband gave me a pulse alert because the music of the movie affected me a lot i think it is very lucky for the oscar nominees that the movie was not released in otherwise oppenheimer and the other nominees would have no chance against dune i can already say that dune will win all the awards at the oscars in i bow to denis villeneuve and look forward to the third movie,positive
597,there really isnt a movie to compare this to it is so insanely well done absolutely lives up to all the hype you can tell that this movie was made by people who care about what they are delivering to the audience they didnt cut corners and they delivered a masterpiece they do an amazing job of immersing you in the world and you deal fully invested in the story i cannot think of one way the movie could have been improved the only complaint i have is that i was left wanting more i cannot wait for dune messiah to see how the story continues i guess i will just have to read the books in the mean time,negative
598,i rarely ever write reviews but i felt i had to after watching this filmim a massive fan of the first film probably my favorite behind into the spiderverse and maybe interstellar and denis is by far my favorite director so my expectations were basically in earths orbit and it still managed to surpass themi have never read the book as i wanted to wait for this film before i read it so i had no idea what i was in store for but i loved it and this was probably the best cinema experience ive ever had especially since i got to watch it a day early in the biggest screen at the cinema i work at all by myselfthe acting is great especially austin butler the cinematography is again fantastic the visuals are mesmerising the score by zimmer is amazing etc i could go on but you get the idea go watch this filmand now i shall hibernate while i wait for dune messiah,positive
599,dune part delivers a sandstorm of epic proportions continuing the journey of paul atreides in a visually stunning and thrilling sequel the desert landscapes are breathtaking the sandworms are terrifyingly majestic and unlike other recent blockbusters humour is subtly woven into the narrativealthough there were the necessary details book omitted from the process of crafting something from a page onto a screen it didnt feel like it was missing any character depth especially from the key playersas the bene gesserit saying goes i must not fear fear is the mindkiller and director denis villeneuve wasnt afraid of taking on this second half of this story he masterfully crafts a world that is both familiar and alien drawing viewers deeper into the intricate web of politics power and prophecy dune part is a mesmerizing cinematic experience that will leave you eagerly anticipating the next instalment,positive
600,its the peak of hollywood production and yet its a snoozefest what happens when you have an overly polished cinematic experience packed with characters that have no real personalities or depth of any kind you get dune i found my self sluggish in my chair falling asleep at multiple points in the movie the studio must have required a hour movie because the movie was packed extremely slow scenes actual slowmo scenes and scenes of landscapes with zero substance the movie could have easily crammed in minutes if they wanted to i figured after the first one that it surely couldnt be another sleeper and boy was i wrong if theres a dune ill bring my neck pillow next time,positive
601,im now a huge fan part was good but a bit too slow but timothe chalamet performance was outstandingpart one gives us a small glance at whats coming and kept us waiting eagerlyill try to review avoiding any spoilernow onto part it started a bit slow again seems like some of the events of the first hour should have been in part one but again we keep learning how paul gets his legendary status and supportbut the second part of the movie is glorious we have so many great characters and development all over the place the final battle is exciting effects are awesome and soundtrack was on trackthis is probably the great work of this generation and my kid was excited with the whole story and universe i wish they would have given us some of the hints of whats coming but im happy on how it endedim not loving zendaya in this film i feel her acting range is not suited for this one as shes the weaker cast in this film everyone else is very involved in their character but shes so plain and linear and doesnt match how great timothe performs herecant wait for the next deliveries im definitely going to see this movie several times as we need to support good movies when they appear and fully recommended,positive
602,to be honest i found dune pt tedious and longwinded to watch compared to the riveting pt i dont know why but it almost felt directed by some other director than d v dont get me wrong the movie was beyond a doubt monumental as it should but the slow scenes felt too long whereas the battles seemed to play on fast forward wham bang thank you maam what i mean everything seemed too easy for the protagonist with little or no preparation and tactical planning that said although i have read the novels and can compare all of this felt that corners have been cut and a lot even for a movie over hrs long,negative
603,i read the first two books in the series in the early s and saw david lynchs movie sometime in the s i was prepared to be impressed due to all the glowing reviews and box office success that dune parts and received i just watched them back to back and have to say i am mightily unimpressed since i only remember the major plot points i wasnt necessarily irked by what appear to be substantial changes in characterization as noted by other reviewers although i do miss the powerful lisping child alia from lynchs movie by the time the kids born in this movie shes already going to be like years oldsadly there was a whole lot of other stuff that was very irksome indeed i thought the acting was no more than passable with chalamets performance drier than arrakis itselfthe special effects look good but by now gorgeous special effects are par for the course although since so much of the movie took place at dusk or night or indoors you often couldnt really see much anyway so theres thata gripe how come if you stick a single thumper in the sand in about a minute and a half youve got a huge worm approaching and yet you can have a few hundred fighters charging in all directions as they fight hand to hand like so many twolegged hors doeuvres and what theres only deaf sandworms in that areaand another whats with all this sword fighting anyway you telling me they couldnt invent a projectile gun or a ray weapon that would somehow slow down just at the point of reaching its target so as to enter the vaunted personal force field aura even if not a lot of the bad guys are shown dying their force fields dimming as somebody slashes them with a swiftly whizzing sword which is being wielded at such speed that it never should have gotten through the force field at allalso the movie is at pains to show as in the book that you have to be careful in the desert to sand walk so as not to attract any worms except of course when you dont have to be doing that at all like during the aforementioned fighting or when somebody may traipse up and not sand traipse either a very high dune to get yet another glorious view and is this the first such shot or the th milking of same into the distance and apparently no worm can detect it maybe they had all just had a really big dinnerall in all i thought it was a pretty boring movie and the first one while better wasnt all that exciting either so after this snoozefest finally approaches its end we realize theres going to have to be a part before you get anything to actually happen in the holy war not for me thanks,positive
604,dune part two accomplishes more things than any scifi epic in the last years it not only effectively conveys the plot of the novel but does so with great emotional density the performances are top notch across the board timothee chalamet cements his legacy as a true star showing a wide range of emotional capital and as far as the visuals the film has no equal the wormriding sequence is one of the most aweinspiring moments of any movie ive ever seen the music and sound design are perfect clearly the better of the two films dune part two is not just my favorite scifi film it may be my new alltime favorite film its honestly that good,positive
605,frank herberts classic sciencefiction epic dune has been rewritten and filmed many times and there are others planned for the futurehowever it is necessary to watch this new release for comparison yes the story and even the pronunciation of words vary from the book however for those that have not read the book some parts of the movie you will not like are right out of the bookthe cast alone is worth watching and even though you tend to say now where have i seen that actor before the actor does not stand out past the character they are portrayingthe total abscence of the fj agenda makes this movie a gem,positive
606,this is the peak of a scifi movie everything blends perfectly in this movie from the cast the action the way the plots transit and the amazing music that complements the storytelling i went into the cinema with a high expectation after three years of waiting but i was still joyfully amazed i will definitely watch it again and again once every month to appreciate the full beauty of the designdenis did an amazing job elevating the story created over forty years ago presenting it in such a classic decent and even luxurious tastethe only pity i feel is that denis didnt make it a hour film or even break it into two parts the pace could be a bit rushy i just cannot get enough of it,positive
607,dune the avatar and the titanic the three movies anyone who can should watch on the big screenthis movie was made to impress and it succeeded its been a while since the last time i enjoyed the cinema experience this much not to mention that throughout the movie i didnt look at the time not even once to see how much is left rare for me this movie had my full attention from start to finish for hmin and i wish it were even longer and this is coming from someone who will generally watch movies in or more increments at home yep but not with dune an amazing movie loved it cant wait to watch it again,positive
608,i saw dune part last night and was up very late afterwards thinking about what id just experienced i cant imagine it being possible to adapt the frank herberts novel into film any better than denis villeneuve has done its a highlyrefined masterpiece a monumental achievement in science fiction thats brimming with thematic complexity movies like this should be a wakeup call to hollywood encouraging the industry to take more risk and let the creative geniuses like denis cook without compromisethe hans zimmer soundtrack eyewatering cinematography gorgeous visuals topnotch acting and intricate storyline were all woven into perfection every shot is teeming with life there wasnt a dull part about dune from the moment the bass induced voice boomed through my lungs to the end credits i felt completely captivatedill be going back to the theatre to watch dune part again asap,positive
609,im just delighted sitting in the cinema i breathed every other time so as not to accidentally miss a scene i lived with the characters every moment i cried and exhaled i will not exaggerate when i say that for me it is a masterpiece that i want to see again and again and again so the director departed from the canon the life of the freemen is not revealed as in the book but it is herbert in my opinion villeneuve did everything he could and did it beautifully as for my favorite actors butler is the best for me to portray faith rauta like that i have gold in my limbs from his cruelty and charisma its incredible the audio work is colossal maestro at his height,positive
610,sorry but i cant agree with the enthusiastic reviews at all because compared to the original the desert planet from this remake unfortunately cant keep up at all not keep up with the acting performance not with the science fiction elements which were already more imaginative and better in than in the current vision version and certainly not with the mysticism that was transported over to the original the main actor would have been better off in a childrens movie epic but he came across as sympathetic but by no means like a leader in addition the intellect lacked physical strength and size the film which was performed and presented much too loudly unfortunately disappointed me all along the line it is better to enjoy the original,positive
611,dune part two is the muchanticipated sequel to the film dune both based on the seminal science fiction novel by frank herbert directed by denis villeneuve the film continues the story of paul atreides as he navigates the treacherous politics and conflicts of the desert planet arrakis also known as dune with stunning visuals a compelling narrative and a stellar cast dune part two promises to be an immersive cinematic experience that delves deeper into the richly imagined universe of the source materialset in a distant future where humanity has spread across the galaxy and formed a feudal society dune part two explores themes of politics religion ecology and the human condition at the center of the story is paul atreides played by timothe chalamet a young nobleman whose family assumes control of arrakis the only known source of the valuable spice melange the spice is essential for space travel making it the most valuable substance in the universe and the focus of intense political intriguein dune part one we saw pauls family house atreides betrayed by their rivals house harkonnen leading to their downfall and pauls journey into the desert where he discovers his destiny as a prophesied messiah figure the kwisatz haderach the film ended with paul and his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson joining forces with the native people of arrakis the fremen as they prepare to take back control of the planetdune part two picks up where the first film left off with paul and the fremen launching a guerilla war against the harkonnens and their imperial allies the corrupt padishah emperor shaddam iv as paul embraces his role as the kwisatz haderach and gains the trust of the fremen he must also contend with the visions of the future that come with his newfound powers these visions which are both a blessing and a curse show him possible futures where he becomes a savior or a tyrant leading to internal conflict as he struggles to determine the right pathone of the central themes of dune part two is the idea of destiny versus free will pauls journey is guided by prophecies and ancient traditions but he also has the ability to shape his own fate this internal conflict is reflected in the larger political struggle for control of arrakis as various factions vie for power and influence each believing they are following the path laid out for them by fatethe film also delves deeper into the ecology of arrakis and the role of the spice melange in shaping the planets ecosystem the spice is produced by giant sandworms that inhabit the deserts of arrakis and its extraction has had a profound impact on the planets environment the fremen who have adapted to life in the harsh desert have a deep respect for the planet and its fragile ecosystem seeing themselves as stewards rather than exploitersvisually dune part two is a feast for the eyes with stunning landscapes intricate costumes and cuttingedge special effects bringing herberts vision of arrakis to life the films score composed by hans zimmer adds to the epic feel of the story with sweeping orchestral themes that underscore the drama and emotion of the narrativein addition to chalamet and ferguson dune part two features a talented ensemble cast including zendaya as chani a fremen warrior and pauls love interest oscar isaac as duke leto atreides pauls father and javier bardem as stilgar the leader of the fremen tribe that takes paul in each actor brings depth and nuance to their role helping to flesh out the complex characters that inhabit herberts universeoverall dune part two is a worthy continuation of the story begun in the first film expanding upon the themes and ideas introduced in dune while setting the stage for an epic conclusion with its compelling narrative stunning visuals and talented cast the film is sure to captivate audiences and further cement villeneuves reputation as one of the premier directors working in science fiction today,positive
612,the universe theyve created is amazing the movie is a visual and audio masterpiece however the script is written so bad and the whole movie is so rushedwe get zero character development throughout the movie feydrautha joins the movie and gets what around mins screen time in total and then he dies in a nonsense fight scene when he already defeated and put paul on the ground and stabbed him such an interesting character and we learn nothing about him then he dies like its nothingwe learn almost nothing about the universe and all the technology they have there is zero story depth in this movie this universe needs a much better lore but this is not something you can get from villeneuvetake half of the story in this movie and you can make another hours oscar movie with that by giving some depth to the story so sad and disappointing work from an overrated director,negative
613,im sorry but despite all the hype villeneuve has made just two long boring movies with flat cold characters that never make you get involved or to care for what they are doing soundtrack is just a lot of noise trying to overwhelm you but also extremely boring and often annoying what a waste they could have helped to make every scene more moving it only makes sense for the harkonnen world that is supposed to be disgusting the visuals are quite great for the harkonnen obviously drinking from gigers ideas which is good since he was the one involved in jodorowskys dune for this matter even the worms are not so impressive and have a flatworm personality sorry for the bad joke i guess cgi is also making everything more flat grey and false i think javier bardems performance is one of the few things that gives a little authenticity to the story amazingly enough i probably would prefer lynchs dune if they released his original hours cut,negative
614,ive never given a perfect score as i dont believe perfection can ever be achieved yet denis villeneuves adaptation of the incredibly complex and convoluted world of dune is pure genius its better than stars when i go to see any movie version of a book it is with the low expectations of hoping to see something reasonably close to the writers vision villeneuve however makes major revisions to the story line and its focus and yet weaves all the depth and meaning frank herbert crafted into his story in a little over two hour viewing time and the cinematography is stunning a masterpiece by one of todays best directors,positive
615,truly a remarkable filmi was utterly captivated by the stunning display before methe meticulous attention to detail the incredible sound effects and music the exquisite cinematography and the superb performancesi felt an immediate urge to return to the imax theater for another viewingits evident that denis villeneuve poured his heart and soul into this projectthe soundtrack by hans zimmer is just the cherry on topdont miss out on seeing it you will not regret itrarely have movies left such a lasting impression on me only jurassic park and gladiator have evoked a similar sense of awe,positive
616,everything from the cinematography the score the acting the script just simply incredible this is everything that cinema needs in this time of poorly written and directed cash grabs you can tell when you watch dune part that heart and soul has gone into everything in this film i loved the first and was unsure if it could possibly be topped by denis villneuve has done it again with what i am certain is his best workif youre scared of scifi films or unsure on scifi films it is not that scifiey its very much a story of revenge relationships and heartgo to the cinema today and watch dune part,positive
617,only epic movies make it in this realm of greatness it makes me think of once upon a time in the west star wars and just a few others the cinematography is something ahead of his time and so dose it the score hans zimmer push his limits with this ones just like in interstellar onother movie ahead of his time why we can not have more like this in hollywood please we want this kind of movies we are sick and tire of mediocre movies i know that to makes this kind of movies cost an arm and a leg how ever better to do good that bad we want interstellar and dune please bows for vilneuve he got his oscar for this one,positive
618,this is how to feed the beast known as fans of dune the visuals the sound the atmosphere it was just full packagethough there were a few things i kinda wanted to get more the story around instead of the blissful visuals with no dialogue i tried to nitpick on the cgi but i found it stunningmore of the bene gesserits would have been perfect the lack of certain character in the ending was a strange choice alia her gom jabbarthe lack of the weirding way more focus on religious fanatics brute violence was a bold choice but it did kind of work with the storytellingas with all movies they tend to stray a bit from the source but i really enjoyed itand this movie can proudly crown itself a sequel better than the first instalmentwell done,positive
619,okay listen i go to a lot of movies and im not an easy person to convince a movies is actually good but holy this movie i knew before i went with a friend of mine it had good rumours but actually watching it was something else the sound effects just everything including the story it was all so fine really if you havent watched it yet in the cinema go as soon as possible part is a must watch before you go to part it pretty much educates you within the dune lore and is very helpful to understand the world theyre in honestly if i would say im not excited for part im lying they shouldnt rush tho but i cant wait,positive
620,despite part one largely following the plot of the book quite closely part two takes the film series into unknown territory too much of the book has been cut or drastically changed throughout part twothe dialogue has also taken a hit being overly simplified for modern audiancesthe pacing is hitandmiss with the movie seeming to rush past major plot points in places and then taking seemingly forever to progress past othersa number of desert scenes also look incredibly fake whereas part one was almost seemless with the cgi sand not detracting from the watchability of the filmthe film is watchable just not as enjoyable as the first film,positive
621,as a fan of syfy and basically read herberts books and his sons prequels and continued stories of dune this nd film far exceeded my imagination granted the original lynch film is still a cult for dune this adaptation is noted as grand well written script beautifully done cinematography also the development of dialogue construction is sheer perfection and adding performance of the actors how does a underdog become the hero and messiah of a planet by going deep into character and emotionin other words having the viewer believe they are the messiah and understanding the flaws the soulful depth and pain of that character this film is now the mark the epilogue of cinematic excellence i was truly happy to sit through the shifting of this magnificent version of dune,positive
622,after a first movie i enjoyed so much i expected nothing less that the same quality mystery and action its been disappointing that i found an interesting movie i like but nothing else and far from the overall impression i got from the first one specially the extrange lack of the powers that paul just should have developed after drinking the water off life that is a key moment but not in the movie clearly it is necessary at least a rd moviethe deaths of the harkonen also are treated in the movie as absolute lateral and pum fast and easy too easy for my tasteit also shows too many moments the vision of the war the dialogue with the sister no comment and absence of the guild mentats and so on,positive
623,what do i not understand about this movienow that i have seen it and see both user shares here mostly with masterpiece as the title and in various professional reviews praising and praising this film i count on many not useful after publishing what i now have in mind but stand well in it i dont think this movie is particularly gooddune part was for me a promising start although i prefer movies to have an ending rarely have i been more disappointed than when i finally got to see dune part ill explainthe was the prelude i thought unlike david lynchs dune director denis villeneuve used part to establish the story the characters i could then forgive that in that film too i thought the whole thing was slow and partly boring although the dune part film was also beautifully shot i thought that part would offer more actionoriented exciting action than it largely doespart continues in the same vein as the first film endless dialogues a slow love story that never quite convinces endless scenes beautiful yes of sanddesert scenery a long period where endless time and scenes are spent on the main characters inner struggle about what he should become and dowhen the film finally has some punch the showdown between paul atreides and house harkonnen and the emperor remains incredibly tame and unexciting one fight scene and then its all overtimothe chalamet is a shooting star and a skilled actor but he doesnt convince me in this movie i dont think hes suited to be a tough leader in a grand sci fi adventure like this is supposed to be for me in this role i actually dont think he fits this role so this was jarring for me as wella bunch of the best actors we have today are on the cast list of little help to me the scenes with the worms are only marginally better made than in the version is it not possible to achieve something better with todays technologyi read that the third dune movie is in the works im not going to spend money on watching it maybe when it comes on a streaming service i have otherwise im done,positive
624,dune is a cinematic masterpiece that will transport you to the spice flowing desert planet of arrakis and more from the first shot to the last the world building feel so natural and intuitive we get to spend a lot of silent and intimate moments in between moments with all the characters because of which the big moments feel like they were earned not given the dialogues are simple regarding the religious themes and ideas of the fremen culture so if you listen and follow carefully it will all make sense every single department of dune has given us the cinema fans and the film industry a masterclass in filmmakingdune part two is a hour and minutes of cinematic masterclass,positive
625,this whole film was amazing the game time was perfect the fights was good the last fight between the two chosen one is insane i never rate any film ever but this film is deserving a good rate cant wait to see the next episode the characters build up was also good the effects wqs incredible too every film should be like similar to this in the story line and the whole concept this is not that slow like the first episode the actors acting was incredible aswell after the half game time of the film you cant really saw the next move in the film it was mysterious even the ending was mysterious,positive
626,i didnt care for the fact that alita did not make an appearance as in the book she is the one that killed baron harkonen the timeline is much shorter than the book as the book took place over years and years but the time line from when the harkonens attack at the end of the first movie and the end of part is clearly less than a year the part that bothered me most is that chani went into the dessert when kn the book paul took the princess but made it clear that chani was his mate and the he would never give irulan a child and he would not follow the bene gesseritts plans to control the bloodlines throughout the ages,positive
627,i love it they made it better then first one sounds and effects were perfect i watched at imax and i felt it actors were good they played well the movie near perfect the end cant be my favorite scene but it was fine i beleive paul muadib usul what a great history and story he was badass this is all my ideas for this film you dont need to read after thisthe first thing you should know about the movie was the story behind it all in this video is the movie where you get a sense that it was created to help the movie to make it look better and more like it is the story of a true hero in a different world,positive
628,there arent many films out there in which the follow up betters the first but with dune part we have not only a winner but an epic masterpiece which doesnt disappoint even once everything works amazing story screenplay script cinematography score actors the lot denis delivers when so many others have failed the pace of the film was a major plus factor as well at no point are we left questioning how we have got there nothing was rushed unlike many other films that feel the need to overload the audience which for me ruins a film the only downside is we have to wait another years for part,positive
629,what happens when you give an expert filmmaker like denis villeneuve a massive movie budget and a massive amount of talent to work with you get a massive powerful movie i left the theater thinking i just saw the movie of the yeari was aware of the hype going in but did not expect to personally give dune part a but it reminded me of the full potential of cinema there are many movies that entertain me but this one was more than simple entertainment it was an experience its not often a movie gives me goosebumps and i got them multiple times throughout this moviei thought to myself while watching this is what topnotch movie making looks like i also thought this has got to be the most expensive movie ever made its visually out of this world in a time where streaming movies at home is the most popular way to see a movie dune part is another reminder of just how special seeing a movie in theater can be the cinematography and sound alone make this a movie that must be seen in the biggest theater possibleits hard to believe without seeing it but dune part will be counted among the best sequels ever made best scifi films ever made best literature adaptations ever made and perhaps best films overall ever made,positive
630,this is just based solely on the movie this is a movie reviewing website after all not a book reviewing site unfortunately like many modern movies it looks amazing the work riding scene alone was unreal but it also jumps from scene to scene with no real coherence i understand a movie is a series of shots edited into scenes that make up a movie however the scenes have to flow together to create a coherent narrative maybe its just me but so many films these days seem to have a disjointed narrative ie jumping from scene to scene without the proper flow this film seems to be no exception yes it is well acted and looks amazing but why cant movies have coherence,positive
631,denis villeneuve delivers nothing short of a monumental achievement in sciencefiction filmmaking and the best adaption of frank herberts dune up to date the world is captivating the visual effects and the production design are flawless greig frasers breath taking cinematography accompanied by zimmers sumptuous musical score bring you into the story of the madness of conquest and the power of belieffilled with breathtaking images stunning action its a story that transcends its genre a story that is dense as the world of dune remains intriguingly complex full of characters whose roles shift and evolve and even if it may take five and a half hours for his character to truly come to life two films in chalamets evolution as paul gives everything a center his subdued yet compelling performance serves the thematic ambiguity of pauls character well zendaya gets more screen time then in the first film but for me the standout performance came from rebecca ferguson during this film i truly understood why she was best cast for this role javier bardem further enriches the ensemble castthe best new addition to the crew is austin butler as the barons baldpated hyper vicious nephew as for florence pugh even if her character is only getting a certain amount of screen time amidst dune part twos cast of returning characters her impact could not be seen as minimal setting the scene for further character development other newer characters like lady margot remain a bit more unexploredin our age of everincreasing runtimes its a rare achievement that the films minute length feels really earned but i do wish it had even more even more run time to allow more time for the most uncomfortable emotions to linger on in some scenesultimately dune part two is a grand entertainment that also sustains the main ideas of frank herberts novel exploring the dark aspects around religion politics power and violence absolute sensory overload this must be seen on the biggest screen possible with imax being almost like a chiefs kiss if dune part didnt make you a believer part just mightcannot wait for dune messiah for us to have the complete trilogy in the vison of the masterful director denis villeneuve,positive
632,denis villeneuves continuation of frank herberts epic dune delivers a cinematic experience that is both aweinspiring and demandingthe film maintains the visual grandeur of its predecessor presenting the expansive desert landscapes of arrakis in breathtaking detail villeneuve continues to employ outstanding special effects and meticulously crafted sets that fully immerse the audience in the world of dunehans zimmers score once again provides an impressive musical backdrop that perfectly complements the films mood the music enhances the emotional depth of the scenes creating an atmospheric richness that captivates the viewer zimmers powerful and evocative soundtrack significantly contributes to the films epic feelthe performances are consistently strong timothe chalamet portrays paul atreides with a blend of vulnerability and resolve making his journey as a rising leader believable rebecca ferguson shines as lady jessica while zendaya takes on a more prominent role as chani with her chemistry with chalamet being notably palpable stellan skarsgrd as baron harkonnen and javier bardem as stilgar bring necessary depth and intensity to their roleshowever a notable critique is the films occasional sluggishness while the detailed portrayal of the world and character development is appreciated the narrative sometimes drags some scenes feel extended and could have benefited from tighter editing to maintain a brisker pace this languid pacing can occasionally pull the viewer out of the story and diminish the suspenseoverall the film is an immensely powerful continuation that impresses both visually and audibly hans zimmers music and the strong performances contribute significantly to the films atmosphere despite the episodic slow spots which can make the viewing experience somewhat taxing the film remains essential for fans of the first part and the science fiction genre who are ready to engage in a profound and visually opulent adventure,positive
633,not so far ago the cinematic experience was something special magical if you want that magic was created by artists those in front and behind the camera eye each one of those artists have their own code their voice in the choir of picture makers a variety of tricks on their sleeves movies today specially mainstream films apply just one code one voice one trick the capitalist one exceptions arises from time to time and im very sorry that villeneuves dune is not one of them herberts work deserves it but mr villeneuve and mr spaihts perverted one by one all the achievements established in the fantastic saga a excruciating sacrifice in the name of artificially created mainstream acclaim and money of course is this the same villeneuve that directed arrival a well crafted science fiction movie big money says no for the sake of profit and surely is a sad happening but we have seen that many times already another example that comes to mind is the last avatar pastiche as disappointing and devoid of soul as this last fiasco that im nailing nowi came from a different generation times almost forgotten when going to cinema halls implicitly meant some brain gymnastics today spoonfeeded audiences anxious of the last bombastic digital effect cant cope with something more complicated than passing screens on a game console because thats what villeneuve and spaihts had perpetrated ive read an interview with mr villeneuve when dune part opened in my city i dont like mesianic figures explained thats ok just the same as in frank herbert books but alas mr herbert needed to create a messiah first in order to demolish later such a figure but in this disgrace of a film the director is eager to destroy him right from the start and a neat job he does for sure in the interview villeneuve also said that dialogue is for theater and tv not for films and thats something one can ascertain without doubt seeing the movie adolescent romantic drama based on pouty faces chani engulfing the screen and like a cheap tv soap opera the insecure and fragile paul atreides chalamet shouting at mama and crying for lost love thats the way paul atreides trained since he was a child in the art of war selfdefense governance and a multitude of sciences not forgetting the pranabindu physical and mental control in the bene gesserit ways who passed the gomjabbar with flying colours the best positioned candidate for being the kwisatz haderach is portrayed in this foul perversion of a film like a crybabywhat a nerve space guild absent the mentat human computers every house has one utterly omitted in this film and the butlerian jihad never explained the bene gesserit and the quest for the superhuman being merits only a few lines the corrino and the rest of the houses bene tleilax the interrelation between all these galactic powers too much material severed the essence of the conflict is eliminated how can anyone understand the importance of the spice in the dune universe if what is used for is not even hinted the spice must flow but we dont know whynavigators use the spice that expands the mind to fold the space and travel at interstellar distances without moving thats the basis of the empires control over the galaxy thats the plot device that ties all together and thats the reason why who controls the spice controls the empire furthermore the navigators of the guild float in an atmosphere made of spice gas they need the spice to survive and the drinking of the water of life in addition with the contact with the spice is the reason why paul muabdib becomes the kwisatz haderacha male bene gesserit who have access to the memories of both his male and female ancestors as well as the capacity to bridge space and time with prescient ability this wonder of epic sci fi this marvel of a plot all this and much more goes to the trash bin without any remorse and doing so cripples the meaning of the saga all the wayits laughable to see what they made with any of the principal characters in order to appeal the target audiences to name only one that irritates me the most ill go with chani lyetkiness daughter a new little detail overlooked destroyed from the original tale as many others and a very important one being the imperial ecologist daughter chani knows first hand the struggle in arrakis from the very moment it starts a strong female character in frank herbert endowed the dune female characters with a determination power and selfconfidence far ahead of its own time and as we see right now in the portrayal rendered by this film ours chani was no exception the love she feels for paul is unbreakable just as is pauls in response with no condition whatsoever a cunning warrior follower of the arrakean traditions with a great amount of wisdom witness of every step that paul takes to become the one she understands perfectly the political movement that explains the marriage of paul and irulan because she knows perfectly well that pauls vision is exactly the same as her father had for arrakis she believes in the prophecies but in villeneuves travesty is portrayed as an atheist with no faith in his lover believing hes not the one and abandoning him at the end of the movie because pauls gonna marry irulan the last straw chani jealous and adding insult to injury betraying the fundamental role of the emperors concubine as described in the novels in what alternate universe this chani is gonna have babies from a man she despises utterly as we can see in the last minutesother absence that hurts so much is aliaoftheknife the water of life creates in jessicas womb what we can call the ultimate bene gesserit alia atreides the one who inflicts the atrteides gomjabbar to his grandfather vladimir harkonnen killing him and make him float to a worms open mouth the little creepy and charming abomination that uses the voice to overwhelm the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam is sorely missed still unborn in this disaster of adaptation our cinema masters choose poorly once again because in the novel alia is years old when the facts take place seems more suitable for them that paul gets all the killings and also the shouting to the reverend mother to cap it all a few minutes later in the same scene feyd stabs paul in the most irritating fight scene never played before a drunks quarrel has more appeal a skinny wounded guy with a perforated lung panting dramatically for the sole purpose of staying alive slays feydrautha harkonnen the muscular nabaron with hundreds of knife fight training hours a pitiful attempt in raising false stakes in the most hideous way even the poisoned blade in feyds whip the reason why paul can defeat him in the first novel is omitted as well and lets not forget that feyd never stabs paul what else can be saidi will add this i suspect one more odd event a catastrophic rewriting for the rd movie following the pattern of cosmetic empowerment and adolescent banality la mode showed until now our cinematic masters will transform chani in the real hero of the saga the reason that leaves me to believe that future disaster is the artificially division invented by the filmmakers in arrakis between the north inhabitants mostly nonbelievers and the south ones fundamentalists this is the perfect scenario for a civil war with chani leading the northern civilized faction and paul muabdib his southern followers time will tell but let me ask you after this disaster of a movie what kind of denouement can we expect a return to grace if so how in three and a half years we will see the extent of the harm what a pity,positive
634,after part a little underwhelmed with fingers crossed was hoping for better always comparing to the original movie from the s and oh my god did it deliver yes absolutely rooted for every minuteimages stuck in my head almost akin to watching a new hope when i was kid i know that is some comparison but it is truly warrantedthe vastness of the terrain the beauty of the cast probably too beautiful but hey its a filmsome of the scenes especially the arena are just jaw droppingtruly a film for the generation never reviewed or even commented ever but this really is an epic movie setting a new benchmark,positive
635,if i had to describe this movie in one word there would be no way around the word perfectiondenis villeneuve has combined an almost flawless story with ingenious and unique cinematography and breathtaking scenery and this movie came out of itcombined with hans zimmers music which makes you feel like youre on another planet even without the movie this film creates a perfect and almost unique atmospherei watched it in imax and i have to say it was earth shattering if you dont plan on watching this movie you wont find a part of yourself that you didnt know you neededi didnt know a film could impact me in a way dune did,positive
636,usually when you watch something like this you cant help that small part of you that wants to be a critic you think the book was better or i dont like how they adapted that not with this movie its strong powerful every scene stands on its own has purpose and expands the story character introduction is strong acting amazing and powerful the music score almost makes you want to cry sound effects amazing and the graphics are just next levelif you love a good story even if you dont love scifi you are probably going to love this movie and if you are a scifi lover this is the movie you have been waiting for it leaves part in the ashes,positive
637,i am a fan of the books i highly rated the first film and this sequel is just as good if not betteri dont much rate timothy chalamet as an actor and thought he was cast wrongly as paul but i thought his performance was better in this film than the firstzendaya also gave an improved performance as chani after her character was given more development giving her meatier material to work with this time aroundrebecca ferguson and stellan were both decent following up from their performances in the first filmaustin butler gave a good performance as feyd rautha he pulls the psychopathy of feyd off well and doesnt camp it up like sting didthe film follows the second book faithfully and lets the storyline unfold without rushing things along the cinematography is gorgeous to look at made for the big screen and the costumes are stunning props to hans zimmer for the soundtrack too,positive
638,great moviei missed only count fenring thread it was one of the best parts of the books for mebattles in the sand are looking super cool in cinema this entire movie will loose a lot in home tv without good sound and big screen so i recommend not to wait and run to cinema nowplot itself is well executed they didnt portrayed it in blackwhite fashion with good paul and evil emperor paul can be seen as changing gaining selfconfidence and power but loosing his human side which is great perfect characters are for marvel here we have evilor not emperor who keep galaxy peaceful but do a lot of dirty deeds to keep it in good shapeand on the other side our hero who will bring war and destruction to entire universe but he is a good guy for us because he looks well and we follow him for two movie as the main protagonisthe is using religion naivety and brainwashing of bene geserits to gain control in empire who will oppose will be killed,positive
639,visually stunning music is great but the story is a bit rush at the last part if it is a part movie it might be better to cover all the details and push the story to the climate if you havent watch part watch it before watch part if you like part sure you will like part is not a traditional style of action of fantasy movie is more like a cautionary tales that reflect real world religious and politics never the less i would give it a out of is a must watch movie in cinema you wont get and same level of visual and audio effect at home i recommend to watch the imax format,positive
640,this film was stunning in its visual and audio presentation full of grandiose scenes and drama but dune is a complicated human drama not an action story and there is a tremendous amount of talent in this well cast tale but that talent and the story is wasted on a script devoid of story tellingthe best scene in the entire pair of films is near the end when muad dib declares himself duke of arakis finally a great actor gets to act there should have been so much more of thisif villanueva had taken the script from the scifi mini series with this terrific cast and his amazing visuals he would have created a masterpiece instead scene after scene of grand visuals and moody characters just became tediousand i just have to add emperor shaddam was terribly miscast i almost laughed out loud in the theatre charismatic brilliant and ruthless not a creepy and disturb psychopath lol,positive
641,i think ill have to watch this again to decide if its the best movie but i can say its way better than the first moviei have read the book and it is very close to being like it apart from usul paul had a sister in the book and she killed the baron vladimir harkonnen whereas in the movie she wasnt even bornfeyd rautha vs paul was amazing but i really would have liked it to go on for just a bit longerthe scene with the sandworms and the fremen riding them was amazing and when paul called the grandfather sandworm shaihulud i got really interested although i already wasi did feel like the emperor maybe could have had some more screen time but i also think he had enough and paul and princess irulan will now rule the galaxy togethervery excited for dune messiah aswell,positive
642,as great as the visuals are the cgi the special effects the explosions the humongous digital sets the ships vehicles the lore and the look the movie has zero substance like a crash test dummy with half a brain dune one had the experience of not seeing these visuals before but now that theyre established so two feels like a retread and turns into one of villenueves more blander efforts now of course im criticizing a production with some of the greatest crews actors and director of a generation but sorry it fell short for me will look forward to messiah hoping for some more heart and guts,positive
643,dune part continues the story of paul and his mom as they live on after his familys dissemination acclimating with the desert people he continues his path to acceptance and revenge whilst her mom is pushed for deityship as the new reverend motherits biggest strength is that it is a visual feast every moment is a painting vibe deneuve knows how to frame his shot and elegantly present it to the audiencepersonally not my film though its a bit dense for a dune normie like me this truly felt like you actually need to watch dune part one again and relearn stuff and i hated that this film was written to be more of an actual hr min interlude to the third film it was not a film that can stand on its own even with the knowledge you had if you watched the first parti also felt that this came off intensely slow not well paced and overlong the action would only peak for mins towards the end and its barely a climax in fact a lot of the characters in this film are fodder ie butler and pugh and could have been edited out of it and it would still make sense butler is definitely overhyped for how littlebarebone his role is zendaya and chalamet took the biggest chunk of the film but still felt underwritten thats a testament given how long the film feels the religious cult storyline faired better but i felt that it could have been more subtle and organically ingrained into the story rather than driven into dialogueoverall just not my cup of tea i think its overhyped,positive
644,not only was the film gorgeous music amazing and acting phenomenal but they actually stayed pretty true to the book there were a few variations which i understand why they did ex adding in child actors would be difficult but was still a little sad about otherwise the plot very closely followed the original for those who didnt read the book its still a great story and very enjoyable film the cgi was well done and the costumes made it feel very authentic i see why hans zimmer wanted to do this movie he slightly deviated from his usual instruments and made a phenomenal soundtrack id definitely recommend watching,positive
645,they did an amazing job with cinematography and the world building and the character development ive seen a lot of movies in my life and this one here is damn near perfectthe pacing is good a little better then the first one its a must see in theaters for the experience so excited to see where they take the movie next i loved that they started the movie right off where they left it at and the surprises of certain characters and how certain character archs are played out in this movie was handled greatly you can really tell that they were set out to make a masterpiece and not another cookie cutter movie filled with familiar tropes like what they end up doing to star wars for me great job,positive
646,denis villeneuve has managed something that is very rare a sequel that is better than the original moviedune part two joins the empire strikes back and the godfather in that rare listthe way arrakis is brought to live on the screen and giedi primeomg is simply magical and the sheer scale of the project results in in not just a big blockbuster but a piece of artthere is not one moment that the movie doesnt ring through and the performances the visuals the sound the music and the effects all come together very organicallydenis villeneuve has now made or scifi masterpieces in a row arrival blade runner and dune i and ii looking forward to seeing what else this magician can pull out of his hat next time,positive
647,dune part stands as a visually stunning sequel that adeptly continues the adaptation of frank herberts timeless scifi masterpiece led by the talented timothe chalamet the cast delivers captivating performances with chalamets portrayal of paul atreides particularly mesmerizing as he navigates the complexities of his destiny the films breathtaking visuals intricate production design and seamless special effects immerse viewers in the vast and unforgiving landscape of arrakisbeyond its visual spectacle dune part delves deep into rich thematic layers exploring the intricate interplay of politics religion ecology and identity within a sprawling galactic conflict each scene is laden with symbolism inviting audiences to ponder the broader implications of the narratives themesmoreover the film is a thrilling adventure from start to finish punctuated by epic battles suspenseful sequences and poignant moments that resonate with emotion director denis villeneuve masterfully crafts tension and excitement ensuring that audiences remain engaged and invested throughout the journeyas the second installment in a planned trilogy dune part successfully builds upon the foundation laid by its predecessor offering a satisfying continuation of the epic saga its meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to herberts vision make it a mustwatch for both fans of the genre and admirers of visionary filmmaking,positive
648,the entire film gave me what i was looking for the cinematography lighting special effects sound directing and more were all exceedingly good i know that i liked this film more than part however it has enticed me to go back and watch the first again that is what a good movie should do if you go watch this film please take special consideration of paul his character develops so amazingly it is especially present at the end of the film we will understand more how impactful he is there were three themes that stuck out to me the most multiculturalism selfishness and revenge these are all strong themes,positive
649,dune part two delivers exceptional performances with zendaya rebecca ferguson and austin butler standing out timothe chalamet shines especially in the gripping third act visually stunning with flawless effects the film boasts a grand scale reminiscent of scifi classics like blade runner br interstellar t aliens and the matrix while the pacing felt slightly rushed towards the end leaving the viewer yearning for more action its a testament to the engrossing narrative the adaptation of dune messiah and potentially children of dune poses intriguing challenges yet with denis villeneuve at the helm expectations remain high overall a captivating scifi epic deserving of a rating,positive
650,here it comes dune part two with the most rewarding ending since the silence of the lambsi have seen thousands of movies in my lifetime but dune part two stands out for its commitment to cinema itselfa superb job by team villeneuve including fraser for cinematography walker for editing and zimmer for scoringi rarely have these kind of emotions but dune part two has been highly rewarding thanks to frank herberts novel of there is no doubt that director denis villeneuve did his homework in order to bring a book of generation to the big screenthis is filmmaking at its finest chamalet and zendaya nail it with all the supporting castit just a joy to watch dune completely,positive
651,nice atmosphere mortuary but somehow nice as a working product always tragic and godly music but nothing happens or too little too much tension for nothing slow moves clasic hero looks for too many charactersnice acting from the big actors those and zendaya the rest were destroyed by copy paste recipe im sure they can do moreso basically same as the first one but further on the story line just a mm furtherimagine a great set great sound too much maybe but not much to see just drama and drama again with no support in story just for coolnessa big loss for me,positive
652,dune part stands as a cinematic colossus marking a milestone in the evolution of science fiction film adaptations masterfully directed this sequel not only captures the immersive and complex essence of frank herberts original material but also elevates the narrative to a new level of visual and emotional splendorfrom the outset the director demonstrates a profound understanding of the narrative choosing to expand the story in ways that complement and enrich what was established in the first part while dune part took liberties in incorporating an extensive introduction this risky decision lays the groundwork for the vast world and complex characters now explored with greater depth in dune part this world unfolds with overwhelming beauty captivating the viewer in its vastness and intricacythe cast shines brightly with each actor embodying their character with a mix of vulnerability and strength that is seldom seen the characters are welldeveloped showing convincing growth arcs that reflect the central themes of power destiny and humanity that herbert wove into his work this depth of characterization ensures that dune part is not just a visual experience but also one that resonates emotionallythe art direction and visual effects are of stellar quality creating desert landscapes that are both majestic and relentless the attention to detail in each scene from the vast sand dunes to the intricate designs of the spaceships and costumes transports the viewer to a world that though alien feels tangible and real the cinematography masterfully captures this splendor using a color palette that reflects both the beauty and brutality of the dune universethe sound design and soundtrack play a crucial role in immersing the viewer the vibrant and enveloping sound not only complements the magnitude of the visual scenes but also deepens the emotional connection with the story the music both ethereal and powerful elevates every moment from epic battles to tensionfilled silences creating an auditory experience as impactful as the visual onedune part not only meets the expectations set by its predecessor but surpasses them establishing itself as a masterpiece in its own right the film delves into complex themes with a maturity and depth seldom seen in science fiction cinema the exploration of politics religion and ecology central themes in herberts book is handled with subtlety and complexity that enriches the narrative inviting reflectionin conclusion dune part is a cinematic feat that not only honors herberts vision but also expands it in exciting and meaningful ways it is a film that is not only enjoyable in the moment but also endures inviting reflection and debate long after the final credits have rolled with its combination of profound narrative stellar performances and impressive technical achievements this film will surely be remembered as a modern classic and a benchmark in science fiction cinema,positive
653,im not going to give a long protracted review instead its a great movie great special effects which is why i gave it stars but such a poor ending not sure why alia has not bee born yet and the fact that they completely mess up the death of the harkonnen duke who i did not think was menacing in either film i much preferred the duke in the original filmalso chani and paul have a son who has just been killed in the book and chani completely understands that the marriage to the emperors daughter is a political marriage yet the movie has her walking away from paul i think this dilutes the binding relationship between the two characters which is so strong in the booki reread the first book of dune just to make sure i was not missing the plot and then realised that it was the writers and director of this movie that missing the plot at the end such a shame,positive
654,i fell asleep from boredom while watching the first part of the movie yesterday gave it another chance and watched it again and fell asleep againi saw many positive feedbacks about the nd part and wanted to give it a try its slightly better than the st part but still kept me bored for hoursif you compare the whole remade movie with the original one many important details were omitted and replaced with unnecessary sobbings the remake doesnt tell how the story origins and why emperor decided to get rid of the house of artreids who gave him a hint to kill the whole house members,positive
655,truly a must watch best cinematic experience ever and i am oldfrom sound cast performances setshats off still under impressioni was taken aback already by part one but this one was stronger from the first second i was glued to the seat do not know how i am gonna wait until the part three i guess i need to go watch it again every impresiion of the movie is very strongly given to the audience even my wife was taken aback by the movie and the dune is not really her genre so hats off to everbody and just cant wait for part three a masterpiece no doubt about it thanks to all that were involved,positive
656,i love this scifi drama so good the cinematography and soundtrack are outstanding i love how the music feels like its own character the acting is beyond phenomenal a must see for i have seen it twice and ready to go againtimothee chalamet is the new johnny depp of his generation and commands the screenthe story is immersive and i never wanted it to end i left wanting more i recommend you watch part of dune before going to see part it will not disappoint and youll be glad you did stars wars for grownupsi am ready for messiah now come up green light part for us,positive
657,its true that the trailer made me hope for a great film beautiful and spectacular but i had the impression of watching magnificent shots one after anotherits true that its beautiful apart sometimes from the overabundance of special effects which taint the original shotsunfortunately i didnt feel any emotion no suspense no fear no sadness nothing its flatthe actors play correctly but nothing sensational either and apart from the last music of the film i did not find the soundtrack extraordinaryso i think it must be seen it remains visually very beautiful and therefore this film must be seen in the cinema to enjoy it and if possible in imax digital since it was filmed in mmof course its a film that must lose intensity on television and therefore seeing it in the cinema seems essential to me in my opinion it will not remain a great film,positive
658,first part did not really fit me but when i saw the trailer for the part two and later saw all the clips and reviews for this film i knew that if i would miss seeing this on a big screen i could not forgive myself and i am telling you do not miss the opportunity to see this the visuals are stunning not only timothe but all of the cast are killing it the music the storytelling more you think about this movie the more complex it gets the length of the movie is perfect it does not feel long on the other hand you are left craving more if i tell you that i set trough all the titles because i needed to comprehend what i just saw go see it the best in imax,positive
659,im not one for writing reviews but boy oh boy you will need to see this in cinemas for the ultimate experience i just saw it in dolby and i couldnt contain my excitement i loved every scene hell even the villians were top tier i was happy to see this and will be a long time fan coming also hats off to hans zimmer hes done it again with a beautiful soundtrack a must see filmi am planning on seeing this again just incase i missed anything but it is worth watching a nd time i really enjoyed myself and hope that the third installment will leave me feeling the same as this one did,positive
660,its so rare that you look forward to a film as much as this and then arent disappointed it was pure gold from every anglecaptivating story perfectly chosen cast stunning costumes aweinspiring visual effects a true masterpiecethe film takes you on a rollercoaster of a journey from moments of sheer excitement and adventure to chilling darknesspart of what makes it so exhilarating is the anticipation of whats next and never truly knowing what to expecti thought the nods to historical references were clever and the visual effects were excellentthis is a mustwatch for any cinema lover,positive
661,excellent visuals great cast and very close to the book thats something already rare in todays movies but not enough for me to shout at a miracle the defect of the movie is the pace slow and self indulgent at least minutes longer than needed another weak point from my perspective is the almost completely absence of meaningful dialogues and epic lines i always felt a movie that doesnt have at least to lines to be recalled as soon as youre out of the theater its not a great movie that said the experience was pleasant even if long and the photography is more enjoyable on big screen,positive
662,dune part delivers the best sequel experience ever every aspect from acting to story to music is simply outstanding while im a huge fan of timothe austins performance here is equally extraordinary the storytelling is exquisite immersing me visually more than dune part ever did as always there are no words for hans zimmers music ive never paid this much attention to a movie before denis villeneuve has truly outdone himself with this film making it his best work yet the casting is impeccable leaving me eager for more thank you to everyone involved in creating this masterpiece i eagerly anticipate part,positive
663,ah zendayajust not right for this not her fault though that the writers chose to have her be mad at the messiah for most of the movie knife fight climax nothing newboring actually rabban is actually a coward now uhoknot enough worm action we get it the ben geserrit folks dont care what side they are on teased anya taylor joy but have to save her for the part money grabmusic may fit but its all retread from gladiator and every other sci fi movie of the last years wailing middle eastern sounding womanlarge bass blasts at the beginning of wide shotsthats the bad heres the goodspecial fx and set design are pitch perfect lighting and cinematography are masterful bardem wins the audience over and rebecca ferguson is on her game the build up to paul becoming the messiah is very well done and chalamet pulls it offpeople comparing this to empire strikes back are paid by the studios to write reviews this movie is worth watching and is certainly entertaining though with better casting and a climax that did not feel so rushed could have been epic,positive
664,sometimes you are full of anticipation and when the moment is there you can only be disappointed the movie is beautifully shot and de pace in most scenes is comfortable besides the action scenes they are too fast and have no sustenance so you are basically watching some kicking and slapping but have no idea whythe thing that really irritated me was the lack of story and lack of chemistry between the main couple chalamet can act zendaya knows about facial expressions the harkonen are just weird and the worms are surprisingly the stars of the show i wish they gave the story and the cast just as must love and attention then the movie would be at least satisfyinginstead this overly hyped movie is just as bad as the last avatar in which the whalelike being had more to tell then the rest of the cast,positive
665,dune doesnt just surpass the original in every way it blows pretty much most movies out of the water the cinematography is mind blowing along with sound design and so much more everything about this movie screams polish and passion dune is such a complex novel but finally it feels like a worthy adaptation has been crafted with these parts this is a movie not just for lovers of the book but also pretty much anyone who appreciates movies period the cast nails every character with such great accuracy it truly immerses you into the world dune is a masterpiece and left me wanting more and also satisfied long live the fighters,positive
666,let me just say this i watched this with friends we were having really big hopes and when its ended we were like thats itit is established that you cant put on film a complex book on film you have narrow the focus on and dumb it down especially fi you want it to be successful for the masses but extraordinary writers and directors manage to do that and with their magical skills to give you a lot morethis is a movie with beautiful scenery music and sound effects and average anything elsefrom my perspective jessica was made weak for some reason and she supposed to be a perfectly trained bene gesserit when so was throwing up i was like not she has perfect control on her body she has inhuman reflexes and can even control her body ad microscopic levels not to mention her mind is a fortressmentats strategic mindpolitics religion arrakis terraforming freemen mastering their environment a strange universe where humans have super specialized abilities that we can only dream of is not really present hereand lets get to the actions and fighting is really a bore there iare a few basic premises fights are with guns if shield then you move to low speed fighting lasers rock but shield with lasers nuke and we get one scene of attacking a harvester tens of femens being killed so they can kill the ornithopter as it had a shield and then they use lasers logical but next scenes lasers used with ornithopters flying around logiclessnext sword fighting everywhere like its some fantasy movie and fremens jumping aroudn like acrobats killing saurdaukars like they were flies this was really annoying fremen are tigh knit community survivors in a sand world with really good fighting skills sardaukars are product of hell world were everything tried to kill them since they were babies trained from infancy to soldieringtactics and battle only the best survive and reach sardaukar elite status and they have the best equipment in this movie they are idiots running around like headless chickens patheticand we fast forward to an end thats truly lamei cant give less than eight but that is due the list of utterly devoid of creativity movies we have delivered each year just comparing smelling crap rebel moon was this shines like a diamond in the dirt,positive
667,absloutely fabulousblown away to be honest of course everyone reviews films differentlythe time flew byoscars here comes dune part two superb cinematography and the acting was brilliantfingers crossed for part we highly recommend and you must watch at the cinema to appreciate the fabulous story fantastic sound and effects i only went to see dune part and for my husband but i can honestly say the movie makes you leave the cinema buzzingso many outstanding performances with top notch actors and definitely some new stars beginning to shine i did not want the movie to end,positive
668,my husband and i went to see it on opening week im not a huge fan of sifi films however he wanted to see it its a very long film however not part of this film was slow boring frustrating nothing it was absolutely outstanding i was completely blown away not only was it incredibly visually beautiful but the story acting costumes even the cgi just incredible i would happily go and see this film again i am looking forward to part thats for sure i just hope it can live up to the quality of part i guess we will have to wait and see for that one but absolutely a must see film,positive
669,as someone who is usually not into scifi dune surprised me even more than dune especially the black and white fight scene was something else the character development in just this one movie is outstanding and the actors all excell i wish they could get an oscar each its a well thought through movie with only minor rushed moments but at the same time i am grateful that the screentime wasnt wasted on fight scenes but rather focused on conversations and non verbal communication between the characters i can highly recommend this movie to anyone even to those who usually dont like scifi its a must see iconic movie,positive
670,whoa if you miss this at the cinema you missed it that might be the most intense cinema experience ive ever had and im a vmax cinema fanatic its violent its very dark dont let your kids watch it if you got common sense the huge dark islamic influence made me feel very uneasy it makes it a scifi thriller for me verging on horror very sinister and sadistic and demonic very dark indeed but it is movie making cinema brilliance quite amazing its for that reason i will probably take myself to this cinema experience a second time the big cinema experiences seem few and far between these days so i make the most of them,negative
671,so villeneuve is my favorite currentworking director and when i saw all the great ratings and reviews for this movie i was excited about it thinking it must have improved on everything that was wrong with the first dune movie but unfortunately the only thing that improved here was the visuals and the action and they were fine even in the first movie tooi rewatched the first dune again before watching this because i didnt remember much from the first time i watched it years ago and i think i understood the story of the first movie better this time but my overall enjoyment of the first movie and feelings about it were the exact same its a decent introduction to this universe and characters but lacks the needed emotional connection of the viewer with the characters and the characterization needs a lot of work and obviously the story suddenly ending when i reviewed the first movie i said hopefully a second movie would be made to complete the story and give a better characterization to these characters but sadly this movie continued with the same shallow characterization problem as the first filmthese movies arent short either they are nearly hours so they have all the time in the world to make you care about these characters and flesh them out but most of the time is spent on cool visuals and action scenes and dont get me wrong the visuals are amazing absolutely visuals and cinematography but the storytelling and characterization here is or at best so how can a movie be a masterpiece if only the visuals are good but the story is lackingmany people compare these movies to the lord of the rings trilogy and that actually highlights the problems of this movie and also reinforces what a miracle it was that the lotr trilogy turned out the way it was and no one has been able to reproduce the magic of those movies not even peter jackson himselfcomparing dune to lotr youll realize how much thought and work had gone into making lotr and its characters relatable easily making the audience familiar with these characters and allowing them to form a great emotional connection to them lotr was written as an adaptation that the bookreaders can enjoy and the audience who hadnt read the books could also watch and still get the story and understand the characters and their motivations you dont need to read the books to understand every character in the movie and why they did what they did or having to read to make an emotional connection to them the films already did those things masterfullybut dune it definitely is a movie thats made for people who are already familiar with the universe and have already read the books its like a summary with cool action montages of the important plot points that leaves out the characterbuilding and muchneeded parts to make the audience understand the character arc of paul atreidesattack on titan did that with eren yeager and you could understand the transformation of this protagonist throughout the story but in this movie paul just changes suddenly toward the end of the movie and the movie does a poor job of justifying that instead of giving more time to flesh out this plot point and show what happened and show a gradual change in paul we are mostly shown cool visual effects and unimportant scenes with the villains that do nothing to help these antagonists become more than cartoonishly evil onedimensional charactersand i understand that attack on titan is a long animemanga and definitely had a lot more time to make you care about its characters compared to two movies that are only over hours and i also understand that dune is apparently a really difficult book to adapt to a visual medium and that its a miracle these two movies even turned out as decent as they did but like i said lotr already proved that you can have the cool visuals but also have the depth good storytelling and great characterization in your movie toodenis villeneuve has said that he made dune for himself fulfilling his childhood wish and as nice of a sentiment that sounds that is the problem with dune its made for himself and those who already know this story its not made for someone who wants to get to know this world and characters for the first time via the moviesand like i said its not only the protagonists that suffer from a lack of good characterization so the audience can have an emotional connection to them the villains even lack more the introduction of feydrautha and the gladiator arena scene are definitely some of the most unique and iconic scenes in any movie ive ever seen it shows you that yeah this guy doesnt eff around and is different very well but what happens after that he just becomes another bad guy who eats an apple with a knife and randomly kills his own henchmen because they said hello to him not to mention they dont show what he does differently than rabban that makes him better and more dangerous the only thing he does is shoot missiles at the fremen and baron calls it genius really if it was so easy why couldnt rabban do it before not to mention how disappointing barons character is too youd think hes an intimidating and powerful villain when watching the first movie but youre gonna be unpleasantly disappointed by him in this oneand it is sad because villeneuve actually knows how to write good human characters and make the audience have an emotional connection with them hes not nolan hes already shown he knows how to write good characters the audience can relate to with incendies arrival prisoners and many more so i dont know if it was a deliberate choice or he was restricted from making the movie longer and had to cut a lot of scenes that fleshed out these characters moreso i talked a lot about the negatives and i dont want to repeat myself and only talk about the problems i had with it i still give the movie a because the visuals and the music are too good to give it lower but i could even give it a because of the storyso is still not bad but considering the rating and the raving i expected morelike i said the cinematography the direction for the most part the music and the action are all here and its a quality blockbuster that more blockbusters should try to follow but not the storytelling part thoughthe movie is enjoyable and i didnt really find it boring though some scenes couldve been cut out or dedicated to better flesh out the story and characters but its a decent continuation of the first filmwhen the movie came out and received all the great reviews and ratings i kept seeing some people saying they liked the first dune better and i was really confused about how they could like the first movie more if everyone was saying this one is a masterpiece and better in every way but after finally watching it myself i can honestly say that i enjoyed the first dune more too and i cant believe i liked this one less dont get me wrong the first dune also greatly suffers from characterization and better storytelling but it was still a more coherent story than this filmsoverall its not a bad movie but massively disappointed me especially after seeing the great ratings and reviews it received its a movie thats mainly made for the people whove already read the books and know these characters and they can enjoy these movies more than your average moviewatcher who isnt familiar with this story and characters i have the same emotional connection to these characters as i did before knowing them for the first time visuals and action storytelling and characterization,positive
672,dennis villeneuve is a filmmaker with a very singular vision he has made some of the best scfi movies of the last decade and dune part two is no exceptionive now seen the movie in imax and mm film respectivelyfrom a technical standpoint this film is a masterclass in cinematography and visual storytellingevery actor does their absolute best to portray fully fleshed out characters stand outs in the movie are timothee chalamet rebecca ferguson austin butler and zendayathis is truly a space epic for the ages and i can confidently say that dennis villeneuve will enter the upper echelon of masterful directorsthank you,positive
673,it wasnt as cool as the original the worm ridding was too cartoonishbut the lack of the philosophy of the weirding devices that gave tones power to actually obliterate matterand how paul eventually didnt need the devices i think made the original so much more dramatic and divine like the magic of the force in star warsremoving it weakened the story and power of the story lessening it dramatically to the point all youre left with is a big cgi screen showbut remakes always seem to lose somethingits still a better dialogue written and acted versiona little more dragging but most movies these days are getting almost too long,positive
674,why would a great filmmaker needed to put a cheap romance in his films many filler scenes with jumpings throughout the story if i was a year old wathcing a scifi for the first time i would have given this in my opinion if you are really interested in the story of dune dont watch the movie i wanted the read the books but its kinda ruined for my imagination drug addict with an attitude from euphoria will always come to mind i mean cant she act it is always the same gestures and all i know euphoria should not be relevant but only difference in zendayas acting is tying her hair i think i can,positive
675,i was watching it and had the same feeling as when i had reading the book you feel how some power is growing insidethe reason for it is a shining cast strong script and spectacular visual effectstimothe chalamet performed so well that was pole indeed with all his kindness fate and transformationsflorence pugh wow i hated irulan from the book but here i saw an intelligent interesting ladyhere i should say guilty i notice these all the time so in love with little women rebecca ferguson finally nailed it there is no even a sign of this soft and scared jessica jessica from dune kept me nervous all the timechani nah something is wrong here zendaya like came for one more photo shootscript script it is strong finally we watch a fantastic movie and every character is well written everything has logic except for jessica looking extremely happy that the war is approachingthats not an apple to apple dune like weve all read its better to say based on dune they took the idea and were careful with it plans in plans is not something you can adapt but i feel that that the writers did their best i knew what would happen and when but they managed to get mevisual part these epic scenes arrakis is so beautiful when the sun is lowto conclude i want more i want this film to become part of my collection i want to see anya taylorjoy and jason momoa too while i doubt that these will have chemistry but stilldefinitely recommend thats the fantastic movie weve all been waiting for,positive
676,the word that will likely be used most often to describe dune part two is massive expect a whole lot of variations on the words epic and spectacle too whatever big words you apply to the result villeneuve undeniably did not approach frank herberts beloved scifi novel with modest aspirations its his ambition along with the top tier of behindthescenes craftspeople with whom he collaborated that have paid off in this superior followup to the oscarwinning filmwhile the first installment often felt like half a film dune part two locates significantly higher stakes on arrakis while injecting just enough humor and nuanced themes about power and fanaticism to flavor the oldfashioned storytelling more than a simple savior or chosen one story dune part two is a robust piece of filmmaking a reminder that this kind of broadscale blockbuster can be done with artistry and flairthe movie picks up so closely on the heels of the first film that the fremen are still transporting the body of jamis played by babs olusanmokun home after he was bested in the fight with paul atreides portrayed by timothee chalamet after the massacre of house atreides paul chose to go with the fremen much to the consternation of his mother jessica played by rebecca ferguson thinking both paul and jessica were taken by the desert and all hopped up on violence after destroying the atreides interlopers house harkonnen amplifies its attack on the fremen leading to a few remarkably staged battles between the warriors and soldiersvilleneuve and his team deftly fill the first hour with battle sequences that counter the firepower of the harkonnen military and the fremen tribal combatants who often literally emerge from the earth to destroy them bodies fall from the sky as enormous ships burst into flames in a way that feels nearly operatic amidst the chaos dave bautista cannily sketches rabban harkonnen as a wartime leader who is in way over his bald head while stellan skarsgrd leans even harder into a sort of blend between nosferatu and jabba the huttas the battle between the fremen and the harkonnens for control of arrakis serves as the backdrop for dune part two pauls arc from nervous young man at the beginning of the first film to potential leader plays out in the foreground a fremen tribal leader named stilgar portrayed by javier bardem is convinced that paul atreides is the chosen one foretold among his people for generations even as so much of the mythology points to pauls savior role the emo king tries to blend into the fremen forming a relationship with a young warrior named chani played by zendaya paul passes the tests put in front of him by the fremen takes on the tribal name of muaddib and vows vengeance against the harkonnens who were behind his fathers deathdune part two is not just a sequel it is a testament to the power of visionary filmmaking denis villeneuve has crafted a work that is epic in scale yet deeply personal this film solidifies dune as a landmark in science fiction cinema offering a narrative experience that is as intellectually engaging as it is emotionally resonantas the credits roll i sit there spellbound dune part two isnt just a movie its an experience it reminds us that power corrupts that legends are forged in sacrifice and that love can bloom even in the harshest of landscapes villeneuves direction combined with breathtaking cinematography and stellar performances elevates this film beyond mere entertainmentand so dear reader i leave you with this let the spice flow let the sandstorms rage and may your dreams be haunted by sandworms and whispered prophecies,positive
677,music cinematography acting cast everything is absolutely amazing one if not the best movies i have ever watched i just cant wait for the next part that im sure will be as good as this one if not even better i loved timothes performance its one of his better in fact whole cast did such a good job and i loved each one of the performances hans zimmer also made a masterpiece i couldnt image someone else making music for this movie every minute of this movie was keeping me in tension also the cinematography of this film is beautiful if you havent watched the movie yet you need to go see it,positive
678,just great impressive pictures great costumes finally serious scifi again no stupid jokes no black and white plot so simple you want to scream the characters are complex and the protagonists are not just good they dont have a clean slate everyone has his own agendaa few things have been changed from the book but subtly and in my opinion for the better the role of the female characters and especially the bene gesserit has been significantly enhanced that fits well into the story in the books they were too passive too small for me the bene gesserit are incredibly powerful and it makes sense to put this in the foreground jessica and chani also have significantly more personality act more independently and have their own ideasthe ending is not a sweet hollywoodtypical everything will be fine now ending there will be at least one more sequel the material will not be easy to implement on film if you know the books and the rest of the story but so far villeneuve made an outstanding job,positive
679,dune part two is one of the best movies of this generation and that might even be an understatement it is a practically flawless movie with many aspects that just transcend our current expectations for filmmaking and sets a new standard of excellencethe visuals for this movie are so breathtaking it seems almost a disservice to try and put it into words intoxicating galvanizing hairraising heartstopping aweinspiring spinetingling soulstirring these words alone couldnt describe the transcendence and otherworldly feeling you get experiencing this movie on the big screen on imax so do yourself a favor and book that ticket nowhans zimmer completely outdoes himself again with a captivating score that somehow not only rivals but surpasses his previous oscar winner and grammy nominated score from dune part onetimothee chalamet is an absolute star his progression and development as paul atreides is so raw and captivating and i believe its completely within reason to say that this movie cemented his status as one of the best actors of this next generation speaking of the best actors of this generation austin butler was also a standout for his portrayal as the extremely menacing feydrautha notable performances also include the incredible rebecca ferguson zendaya josh brolin and javier bardemoverall this is simply an unforgettable experience and masterpiece of a movie that demands immediate indulgence it was a visual feast that you will walk away from still digesting what in the world you just watched you will be leaving full to your stomach and yet hungry enough to go back for seconds and thirds and fourthsyou might think people are over exaggerating and dune much theyre not go watch it its that good,positive
680,this is the best movie i watched in the past years maybe one of the best in my life just pure cinema not a flick like much others we have been swamped with lately simply its perfect from story to special effects to acting every moment of it is something you will enjoy watching and will remember for long time as something you miss in all movies we watch lately hope this helps in correcting the direction our movies have been taking lately and put things back on the right track i never read the books but after watching this movie will start on it soon and cant wait to see the rd chapter of this masterpiece,positive
681,great movie but not a masterpiece for mehaving loved dune part went in with high hopes but the movie was a bit slow for my liking the last act was a bit of a mess with a lot of plot holes and the last fight was underwhelmingoverall it felt like the movie was the same quality as the first one but with a few misses right at the end the scenes are amazing and epic the setting is great and there could have been a bit more humourgreat acting all around from the stars as you expect from the heavy hitters and great to see timothy mature up in his acting austin butler was a standout,positive
682,this movie was particularly gorgeous and exciting giving all the key moments and suspense that anybody of the sort would love this movie brings the suspense and excitement to keep you engaged and always cautious of whats next a truly wonderful story that is acted so perfectly and well this adaptation has brung the story alive and in the spotlight proving there is not only a lot to it but also that it has a lot more to come and personally i want to see it all i left the theater thoroughly wanting even more for the story and continuing on that i cant wait for what is to come of this movie it is truly a must watch masterpiece,positive
683,not as good as the first movie feels a bit rushed in the last chapter delivers like its predecessor with an amazing sound and visuals which are one of the best in the business but the writing and acting do matter more to me and in the end thats whats makes it a little bit worse than previous movie dennis is great director but dont have your judgement clouded by reviews which are overblown and overhyped like in every other holywood movie this movie keeps your attention and sometimes it makes you think about how life on arrakis is nearly impossible watch it but do not expect to get blown away,positive
684,having first been introduced by my dad to arrakis via the movie followed by my reading the books then watching the extended tv version of the david lynch cinema tale when it became available on dvd and also the scifi mini series on release i very much enjoyed the first filmthe changes though a couple of omissions were disappointing made sense for setting up future instalments and also helped carry the story forwards in a more theatrical manner i was therefore looking forward to seeing this filmas we approached the end of the first half of the film and we got to see feydrautha in the arena followed up by lady fenrings seduction no less i thought to myself i wish my dad had been here to see this hed have loved it and then we got the second half of the film and i immediately took back that thoughthed have been mad as hellwhere the first film set up better avenues for the plot to go into future book adaptations than herbert did he hadnt planned on there being sequels at the time and made certain things flow better and seem more logical to the casual viewer instead the second movie does the complete opposite subtle allusions to the dangers of playing with prophecy were already being wielded too heavily in the first half of this but by the second pauls entire character and that of chani too are being changed wholesale for the sake of that heavy handed use being turned to utter sledge hammermeanwhile drastic changes to the plot not only remove some of the most iconic lines in the book eg usul we have wormsign the likes even god has never seen before i remember your gom jabbar now you remember mine etc but threaten to totally derail the main story beats of dune messiah the next book in the series along with important elements in later ones tooinstead of alia being born and surprising all present in the court by delivering pauls message to emperor shaddam iv when he comes to arrakis after several years of disrupted spice production despite being just a few years old the plot is accelerated to all conclude before her birth instead his identity is revealed in a letter sent to corrinogood grief does no one in this universe fully understand the concept of spies constantly telling secrets in front of staff and servants in this film when they made a big deal of not even having a pet in the room for any such discussion in the previous one is just a terrible movie trope even if every single one could be totally trusted and they know that even imperial conditioning can be broken cos theyve done it that seal on the wax of that messages cylinder would have been recognised by the courier and most importantly the guild workers who are required to transport him between solar systemsas for the guild and the importance of the spice melange well despite being central to the very plot of the entire book series and theoretically this film too their importance is conspicuously downplayed except when it isnt of coursein the books and the scfi channel adaptation was sensible enough to include this paul works out how to create a chain reaction of poison that would end spice production on arrakis the mere threat of doing this is enough to bring the guild and as a result all the noble houses in linethis is how the crusade spreads amongst the stars not a couple of million fremen assaulting a bunch of ships and hoping to take on an entire galaxy theyd lose in minutes if the main vessels didnt simply fold space away from orbit the stolen landers would be lasered out of the sky in the same way the film showed us the taking down of spice harvesters about an hour earlier what did denis forget he had that in his filmthe crusade is supposed to spread by the fact that muaddib ended both the imperial line and the dominance of the guild with little more than the threat of giving a command all knew his followers would obeyand speaking of that threat in the film this is instead made with the potential use of atomics yet said threat is ignored by the landsraad and not carried out when they call his bluff the trouble is it wasnt a bluff in the book he challenges the navigators to look into the future where they see him do it not only is this classic part lacking in the film so is his challenge to the bene gesserit order look into that place where women dare not look you will see me staring back at youmeanwhile the death of paul and chanis first son at the hands of the sardaukar is totally absent as they have had no time to have any children at all in this overt rush to the conclusion did denis get the same itch beniof and weiss did for got this omissions would be excusable but now they may never be parents as the film ends with chani leaving and apparently now hating paul whats going on here is paul now going to have the twins leto ii and ghanima with irulanbut that missing time elapse is important to plot and continuity the first film established how much spice reserves baron harkonnen had and as a result any disruption to the flow could be kept secret from the other houses for some time yet instead villeneuve doubles down on this plot hole by having feyd get the spice production back on track this doesnt happen in the books for a reasonthe first successful assault on a sietch ie taking the fremen on in their own home doesnt occur until the emperor unleashes his sardaukar on tabr to which he notes to the baron that his elite could barely best the women the old and the infirm as the warriors were away at the time having the harkonnen attack the northern fremen strongholds and drive them away would have revealed just how many of them there were in the north which is vastly more than their intelligence network believed as stated in the first movie if this was revealed to them why were they not questioning their other assumptions we can only assume it is because they have decided to suddenly make the bad guys dumb so that the next bit of altered plot can take placefinally we come to the action sequences of the nd halfwhilst they look good they also suffer from the hollywood treatment paul now leads infantry running along the ground towards an enemy also running along the ground this was literally the biggest complaint most people had about the battles from the first movie and its an order of magnitude sillier when the fremen have access to sandworms which they are riding in from one of the other flanks speaking of which where the hell did they disappear to halfway through the battlethe sardaukar are treated like the golden company in season of got they are all brought to one place with none in reserve and get wiped out with virtually no resistance to speak of off screen for the most part was that to save on screen timethis would literally be the daftest thing for the emperor to do put them all in one place that is as fear of his elite troops is one of the ways in which he maintains his rule all planet side somewhere they are unused to and utterly at the mercy of the guild should they decide not to move their space ships it would make about as much sense as the us putting every ship of every fleet in hong kong harbour whilst the entire rest of the us military was deployed in hk itself just because the president was visiting dumb just like the second half of this film,positive
685,the film is incrediblethe acting score costume design special effects everything about this film is so very well doneim a big fan of the book and was curious as to how they were going to tackle or introduce some of the things that happeni felt like what was delivered in dune part two was the best adaptation they could have madethere are changes for sure but a book like dune written the way it was written with lots of perspective and inner monologue was never going to translate to the big screen its tricky adapting books at the best of timesthe limited time a film has to tell a story like dune also would have led to some of the changes in plot and character developmentoverall i think it kept the ideas and themes of the book while telling an incredibly similar fantastic story with incredible visuals and insane score for sure,positive
686,dune i enjoyed it immenselythis started continuously from the first movie and luckily i rewatched the first movie in preparation i would suggest this is a must again the movie was merciless if you had not read the books you would be lost from the start as no explanation was offered and perhaps should go home at this point lolpart of the book is about the coming true of the arakan prophecy of a messiah that will lead the fremen to a green paradise so it is dark and religiously top heavy and so was this movie a brooding dark serious movie with paul and jessica struggling with their inner demons for most of the time and tons of set piece marshall combats no gags heremr villineuve again achieved the impossible by bringing to life this most complex of novels for the fans and it was really quite brilliant and needs to be watched numerous timeswithout undermining the brilliant acting from the cast timothee chalamet was outstanding in his ability to command the screen and convey we were in the presence of a messiah he was never off the screen and it was deeply moving the element about paul being able to see backwards and forwards in time whilst mentioned was not demonstrated really very effectively secondly we needed more demonstration of the voice in its subtletiesthere were several divergences from the book pauls integration into the fremen took years and alia was born with the memories of her ancestors and excellent with a knife this seemed to happened over a summer in the movie secondly chani stands by pauls side throughout even through a political marriage the movie diverges from this however mr villeneuve condensed the spirit of the book without diluting its impetus and frank herberts intentions were respectedperhaps more controversial and of course its my opinion there was unfortunately to my mind one glaring problem there just was no onscreen chemistry between timothee and zendaya it just didnt work also her acting grated she seemed to have attended the ab school of acting using just faces that conveyed petulance irritation or indeed trapped wind she just overworked most of it as if it was for tv we all know for movie acting less is more she looked the part but there just was just no sexual frisson and the accent was too american everyone else modified their to be from nowhere exactly so she was miscast i have seen this actress now in spiderman euphoria and now this she lacks thespianic skills to convey anything more than the superficial just no heft florence pugh would have made a better chani as that lady has the skills when shes humblei thought austin butler was brilliant as the evil nephew bulked up and without eyebrows and the teeth it was a terrific transformation and i love itthe music was amazing throughout as were the worms and battle sequences the cgi set a new standard in meticulous and seamingless continuity we were there we had a parched throat and sand in our faces i did the sand walk back to the underground lolthis is of course a must see and im giving it a outta brilliant except for the romantic elements pathetic and passionless,positive
687,undoubtedly one of the greatest cinematic experiences ive ever had most movies nowadays try to wow you with either visuals action character development and seemingly less and less so everyday with a reasonable plot this movie manages to check off every box it is hard to pinpoint an actor in it that wasnt superb in their role the visual effects especially in imax are stunning and are not simply artistic in nature but actually work to advance the plotthe film is pieced together so brilliantly with each act seamlessly fitting in with the last the score by zimmer is unsurprisingly absolute perfection as wellfor the length of the movie it actually feels quite short which is a huge achievement and shows how immersed you become in villneuves worldhowever i would have liked to see more of feyd rautha they had an epic scene of his in the harkonnen arena but not too much else to develop him for his final battle against paul i also would have liked to see the sardaukar put up a little better of a fight they somehow went from the empires greatest fighters to pretty pathetic perhaps this was to show how strong paul and his forces had become but it just seemed a bit too easy still these are just personal aspects i would have liked to see and are not issues in the movie itselfoverall an epic movie and the trilogy is likely to be sitting right alongside the lord of the rings and the original star wars movies when all is said and donethis is a cant miss in imax,positive
688,a perfect movie got a perfect sequel dune compliments how good the first movie was and it really is what makes the moviegoing experience incredible i really loved the character dynamics the camera work the suspense and the creativity of the movie it definitely had me on the edge of my seat and definitely one of my best movie theater experiences to date everything about this movie was beautiful and it defines the next generation of scifi movies the movie was such a beautiful work of art and im definitely seeing it again on the big screen again in the best way which is imax of course,positive
689,frank herbert writes and dennis villenneuve the menace delivers in this epic scifi for our generationafter reading the st book i have to say dennis did an absolutely incredible jobthe actors are phenomenal for me timothee and rebeca were my favourites but generally all the actors were perfectwhat a visuals what a music by fantastic sir hans zimmerno spoilers but people you have to go and watch it to the cinema dune fan or non dune fan you have towaiting for the new chapter dune messiah i do not know how dennis will manage to deliver but im sure he will manage it as perfect as he did it with part perfect perfect perfect,positive
690,part eclipses the first movie and builds on it setting up what will no doubt be an impressive trilogythe biggest worry i had about adapting dune is paul over the course of the story he changes from a likable kid into something more cosmic and inhuman and that might be a problem for the audience since stories usually need a relatable character timothe chalamet manages this transition skillfully and believably but it still leaves the audience without their relatable charactervilleneuve seems to have hit on an ideal solution beef up the role of chani so that she becomes that relatable character i can already envision her role in the third movie of the trilogy which no doubt is already being planned given the huge box office success of this moviethis is a big departure from the books but the third movie is going to have to be more of villeneuves invention that the first two were anyway,positive
691,sorry about that but this long long long story was really sometimes too much for me the story was told to lame and i felt not surprised in this movie about what will happen the actors are good really i need not to review that what i was really disappointed of was that very indifferent parts getting to much time in this movie with no impact if you would skip that you will not miss thats only my point of view means nothing i was expecting really a very great second part and that was not and something you will probably laugh about me is that i think the actors did not eat or drink in the desert,positive
692,i believe ive witnessed something magnificent and truly it shouldnt be watched outside of the imax format because regardless of what anyone says this is a modern classic im writing this review somewhat for myself because years later when i read it again i want to see how much i elevated this legend and how it managed to close so many things correctly despite its mini flawsfor the past two days the film hasnt left my mind and the reason i give it a perfect is this whenever i talk about the film i get excited because ive seen a visual masterpiece it has incredible cinematography beyond amazing watching the lisan al gaib scene where the fremen walk from a birds eye view the scene between paul and feyd at the end the scene where the fremen accept paul the harkonnen attack in the opening sequence and many others you feel that there are very few scenes like these greig fraser is a master at this besides that hans zimmers music which doesnt mean much when listened to alone but reaches a tremendous dimension with the sound mixing adds a whole new dimension to the film its truly wonderfully designed and fitted denis youre amazingand the casting is phenomenal dave timothe florence zendaya rebecca javier josh austin theyre all fantastic i wont describe each one separately saying this scene was superb everyone fits their role so well and performs so excellently that the film becomes a recital there isnt a single scene with amateurish or shallow acting besides acting something that needs to be mentioned is the stunts the fight choreography was quite good and clear especially the scene between feyd and paul at the end where the music stops and we watch pure fighting for a few minutes it was wonderfulbesides the cinematography casting and harmony the legendary use and synchronization of music there are two more reasons why this film excels and why i rate it highly firstly the film is superbly adapted i wont touch upon this further secondly its a fantastic critique filmthe film critiques every mundane and inherent aspect of human nature whether its the dynastic system coercion around the secret gene preservation logic the exploitation of religion political chaos inefficient use of resources and many more points it hits the bullseye so accurately that its both overwhelming and not tiring while making you feel it a tremendous achievementnow onto the contentious topic of staying faithful to the books and the polemic of how similar it was despite everything its said that both part and part were quite faithful to the book and i believe they were some details might have been skipped or not exactly replicated in the second film but for such a meta and philosophical book series this is extremely normal if everything were portrayed exactly it might have been incomprehensible i wont comment on the films dynasty and operation right now because as a sequel it has to complete the script with good motivation and also convey the characters it portrays well im very happy it achieved thisthe film had a fitting humor some scenes were mildly funny and unintentionally successful which was admirable also i think it will sweep the awards at the oscars next year it could win for its amazing costumes production design adapted screenplay and maybe even best pictureits the peak of cinema that ive ever seen go to imax you wont regret it i didnt delve into the details because everyone should watch it for themselves and try to interpret it in their own way its that kind of filmmay thy knife chip shatter march,positive
693,i originally rated this a because i was sosooo hypedbut now after seeing the movie for the second timeits just a decent movie but nothing memorable to be honestliterally no scenes stuck with me except for the ones with feyd rautha and harkonnens maybei finished the movie and i was like oh welli guess the story moved forwardthats itthe first movie just had magic since the first few minutes and it kept getting better and better the more you rewatch it i originally rated it a but now i think its an and thats the reason we were so hyped for part two especially after watching those amazing trailersi thought were going to see something so grand and epic i also thought it would be longerbut nohonestly nothing memorableand i think i already stopped thinking about itwhat really bothers me denis villeneuve had all the tools and a fan base that really believes in himand you can still see it in some moments in the movieits the glimpse of the magic and epicness he could have given us andi seriously dont know why it turned out to be so underwhelming in the endi swear i was counting the days for this one and i thought this would be such a blast and the trailers were out of this world im so bummed guys,positive
694,ive since the great train robbery all the way up to the barbies and oppenheimer this film truly made me realize how far behind we are in the field of entertainment then are rivals in japan and france i watched desert broll for what felt like minutes throughout the green screening was not done to its fullest potential the actors were miscast with poorly executed dialogue written and preformed marketing was the only thing that could have saved this movie from flopping like with some disney movies i can only imagine what these critics were bribed with to make them say this movie was watchable marketing over entertainment value at its finest,negative
695,first of all this movie isnt for everyone it isnt a movie you go to see with your friends expecting action it also isnt a basic scifi movie its different main theme in my opinion is the importance of relegion and politics and the influence it has on us the benegesserit were shown so beautifully in this movietheir role influence and power they have in dune universe frank herbert is a genius for his time and the themes he writes about are relevant both then and nowdays this movie is absolutely worthy of every praise it gets many might not understand it because they havent read the book and that willa affect their opinion of this movie but i think its fantastic yes a few thing were changed not necessarily for the better but it has to be that way in order for such a complex piece to be understood to the broather audiencethe first and second part are so much different in a good way the chang that characters go through paul jessica are so incredibly shown and you can clearly see that they are a a completely different person by the end of the second moviespecial praises to denis villeneuve he is a genius i got goosebumps far too much times throughout this movie because of the music which is absolutely mesmerizingi really hope there will be a third part and cant wait to go and see this movie many more tikes in theaters,positive
696,i saw this opening weekend in dx at regal theaters the theater where the seats move water sprays in the air air blasts you the theater fills with smoke lightning flashes etc i had a completely amazing experience with the movie denis villeneuve is one of my least favorite directors i thought prisoners sucked blade runner sucked and arrival sucked but his vision came to completion with this installment of the dune series his first dune movie in was rather bland allaround this one was filled with action sequences to the brim i also commend him with his efforts in artistic cinema with the black and white harkonnen world austin butler was really great as was zendaya there are many flaws in the movie such as where it skips parts of the books or changes them mechanics of some of the scifi elements and some of the actors lack of commitment to their roles but overall it was a really fun and entertaining movie that impressed me a lot riding the dx seats while they were riding the sandworms was a blast,positive
697,dune part not only surpasses its predecessor but also stands as a cinematic triumph reminiscent of return of the jedi while the first installment provided a rich context and a tantalizing glimpse into the expansive universe of dune the second part truly brings the saga to life delivering the depth drama and grandeur fans have eagerly anticipatedfrom the very first frame its evident that dune part is a visual masterpiece the cinematography is breathtaking capturing the vast and intricate landscapes of arrakis with stunning clarity and beauty every scene is meticulously crafted drawing viewers deeper into the storys rich tapestry the special effects are equally impressive seamlessly blending with the narrative to create a fully immersive experience that transports audiences to another worldhowever its the cast that truly elevates this film dune part is a showcase of exceptional acting talent with each actor delivering performances that are both powerful and nuanced the characters weve come to know and love in the first film undergo significant evolution their arcs handled with care and precision the growth and development of these characters are epic making their journeys not only believable but also deeply compellingone of the most striking aspects of dune part is how it deepens the narrative introduced in the first film the stakes are higher the conflicts more intense and the emotions more raw its a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat blending action intrigue and emotional depth in a way that few films manage to achieve the screenplay is tight and wellpaced ensuring that every moment feels vital and engagingas a fan ive been waiting for a movie like this for years dune part is not just a sequel its a fulfillment of the promise made by its predecessor its a film that not only expands on the worldbuilding of the first part but also delivers the payoff in spectacular fashion whether youre a longtime fan of the dune series or new to this epic saga dune part is a cinematic journey that you wont want to miss its a jewel in modern filmmaking a testament to what can be achieved when a beloved story is brought to life with passion skill and dedication,positive
698,what a masterpiece this is the new empire strikes back for me star wars has and always will be my favorite franchise then is the dark knight trilogy before watching dune part one and dune part two middle earth was my third favorite franchise now i think dune is my third favorite duology hoping franchise in a future i cant wait for more movies of dune the ending was speechless i need moreeeeee austin butler was scary as hell as feyd the new villain his portrayal was phenomenal as elvis and timothee challamet as paul artreides was spectacular the new anakin skywalker the chosen one aka darth vader this movie is in my top favorite film in history it is epic intense sometimes dark it is like star wars if youre a star wars fan youre going to enjoy this film the fights were epic the dialogue acting cinematography visual effects were phenomenal ive seen it twice in theaters and its very long but enjoyable for me the duration of the movie is just minutes i saw it on imax and is a must see on the big screen highly recommend this film on imax,positive
699,this movie ends the debate right herevilleneuve is currently the greatest filmmaker in the scifi genre on the entire planetarrival blade runner dune dune part iifour backtoback scifi classicsall of them released within a span of only years its just unheard of the man has truly conquered this genre and become its facedune part ii takes everything from its already brilliant predecessor and elevates it to a completely new level its one of the rare sequels that convincingly surpasses the originalsaying this movie is a mustwatch would be a massive understatement,positive
700,a cinematic experience of the highest order ive been awaiting this film and was hoping that it was worth waiting for well it was and id go so far as to say it surpasses the first instalment and i really didnt think that would be possibleeverything here is masterfully done the writing music costumes sets and acting are top notch obviously things are moving a lot quicker than they do in the books but it doesnt detract at all from what is one of the best films ive seen in a very long timi cannot wait now for the next instalment hopefully creating a new trilogy on a par with tlotr well done everyone involved,positive
701,dune part two is the sequel to the first dune film by director denis villeneuve which was released in paul atreides timothe chalamet has now joined the fremen group here he tries to learn about their customs such as their handling of the sandworms paul seeks revenge on the conspirators who destroyed his family with chani zendaya at his side paul goes into battle against enemy troops who serve the emperor christopher walken this sequel three years later immediately picks up where the first part ended this first part was well received by most as an improved start to the film adaptations of the dune story previous film adaptations turned out less well because the story of the dune books is quite a large and complicated story with denis villeneuves first part he managed to properly introduce the dune world and build it up with the political struggle between the different groups with this second film he focuses more on the customs and beliefs of the fremen group who think they can defeat the enemy through a more religious approach furthermore the relationship between paul and chani is also developed a bit more but there are some rushed moments however with this second part many things have to be explained and built upon which means that there are some longwinded moments in this second part compared to the first part this second part has more room for action scenes which increases the pace and tension slightly furthermore it remains more of a political battle between different groups and houses which fight each other more strategically than really physically in contrast to the first part things in this second part feel more rushed like the relationship between paul and chani the aspect of the earthworms and how the fremen handle and ride the creatures is also explained in a somewhat hasty manner so it is not always clear denis villeneuve once again provides beautiful visual images of the different worlds and areas from the dune books together with photography director greig fraser they ensure that the images appear beautiful creative and credible by adapting the dune story from the first book of the series into two films denis villeneuve has given himself and his cast members more space to make something good and beautiful out of the film adaptation this also gives the actors more space to develop their characters and evolve with the time they get in the films timothe chalamet is thus given the opportunity to develop his character from an exploring newcomer into someone who tries to avenge the harm done to his family furthermore he tries to be a savior for the different groups and tries to get them back into balance compared to the first part zendaya is given more time and space in this second part to develop her character more and work on the chemistry and relationship she has with timothe chalamet his character however this relationship can seem a bit rushed which means it cannot always remain so believable for every viewer of the new cast members austin butler steals the most scenes as a dangerous warrior of the enemy army but he and his character could have been given a little more time and development other wellknown actors such as josh brolin florence pugh and christopher walken play their roles well and appropriately but unfortunately do not have such major roles in this second dune film,positive
702,dune is truly a masterpiece i think every frame of the film is so perfect and beautiful you could call this art not film and with dolbyatmos it is truly unforgettable masterpiece the story that contains so many plot twists and unlocking so many new possible films and otherthings is something only dune have almost all the time during the film i was breathtaken somethimes i was just watching the beautiful dune scenes with opened jaw and thinking what the hell just happend in the story i think no film to this day had ever left me in such awe no film ever has evoked so much emotions in me and left my head so confused but on the other hand so mesmerized to dune,positive
703,the film is amazing on the big screen the score definitely fits the film but the storyline is very distorted and far from what frank herbert wrote the timeline is not supposed to be within a year and i fear that the next film will move even further away from dune the messiah now that the timelines have all been put out of placethe build up to the end was great but the final battle was over so quickly i was frankly very surprised and extremely disappointedthe book had subtle twists that were left out of the film and therefore the character development is shallow and the love story between paul and chani is left wantingpersonally i think florence would have played a better and stronger chanivery disappointed that alias birth storyline was completely missed they have an amazing casting and thrown a lot of money into making a sorrowful adaptation of a great book,positive
704,dune fanboys voting this way up literally gushing over it like its the messiah how appropriatespoilers ahead but to be honest the story is so weak im really not giving anything awayboy joins fremen tribe as his family are killed by emperor boy falls for girl and swears hell love her forever and stay with her boy drinks some blue shiz from baby worm and changes his mind now wants to be emperor himself battle ensues until the other tribes wont let him be emperor shocker the end there is also some riding of giant worms very important as this signifies hes the chosen one cut scene everyone and his grandmother rides wormsthere you go ive saved you almost hours and whatever money youd have given up for this nonsense youre welcome im really glad i had free tickets,positive
705,another exemplary work of art by denis villeneuve dune part is absolutely an epic cinema just like dune part this one only should be experienced in a mammoth imax mm screen with largest and loudest formatflawless visual effects such glorious cinematography by greig fraser beautiful production design the heart thumping astounding musical score and sonically sound design by hans zimmer the background score will stay with you for daysthe pillars of these two parts epic adventure films are direction visuals and background scorestory screenplay action sequence are excellentdenis villeneuve greg fraser and hans zimmer have such mastery towards their work direction cinematography and music what a great collaborationbrilliant performance by every actor timothee chalamet zendaya javier bardem rebecca ferguson austin butler stella skarsgard florence pugh josh brolin dave bautista and last but not the least christopher walken were fantasticdune part and part will be remembered as most spectacular scifi action adventure war drama films in the historywaiting for next one from the novel dune messiahthis movie deserves in all aspects,positive
706,i always anticipated that dune part two would surpass the first a common trend in movies like harry potter lord of the rings and star wars dune directed by denis villeneuve impressed me with its authenticity epic storytelling cinematography atmosphere and overall execution while not flawless the performances of the actors and actresses make any mishaps negligible this rendition stands on its own and i havent felt the need to watch the versionthe characters were very interesting we see the religion how paul becomes the next leader bardem i love his character he speaks with such authenticity and he makes it enjoyable the duel between paul vs feyd in a silent moment with no music was insane those were some great moments in the film,positive
707,can a sequel surpass the original yes it can dune part two delivers in so many ways making this one of the greatest science fiction films ever with a runtime of hours and minutes you can easily see that not a single second was wasted sound design was a key factor as it produced such an immersive experience feeling every single bit of bass in the seats visually this film was spectacular thanks to some stunning cinematography the cast was phenomenal providing some of their best performances to date and can easily see some oscar nominations incoming especially when it comes to austin butler stealing the show taking on the role of feydrautha one of the best villain performances in a while to top that all off hans zimmer continues to prove he is one of the greatest composers of all time with such a powerful and emotional score dune part two is an easy reminder as to why i love films so much and denis villeneuve blessed us with such a beautiful and powerful cinematic experience,positive
708,this is simply stunning in every way gorgeous cinematography exceptional sound great performances phenomenal battle scenes political intrigue and manipulation religious symbolism you name it its there and all done brilliantly i enjoyed part one but this is on entirely different levelyou dont need to have seen part one to enjoy this it can be viewed as a standalone film in its own right of course if you have seen part one some elements will be that much easier to grasp its a testament to villeneuve that he has pulled that off without any flashbacks retelling of anything in part one and make it completely understandable to a new viewersome of the set pieces are astounding and my internal cheerleader was whooping silently in my head on a number of occasions on a couple of occasions i resisted the temptation to stand up and cheer its extremely rare for any film to make me feel that way no matter how goodtimothy chalamet has never been better his performance totally befitting the part of paulthe studio were right to delay release so the cast could promote it it deserves to be seen by a wide audience and not just scifi fans and the cast and crew should be rightly proud of the achievement a sold out theatre in the middle of a weekday afternoon tells you everything if you make a movie as good as this the cinema is the best place to see it dont wait see it nowi believe that we will look back on this in years to come and it will be regularly included in lists of alltime classics,positive
709,having just experienced dune part two im utterly convinced that it stands among the greatest films ever created denis villeneuve has delivered a followup that amplifies every breathtaking aspect of its predecessorthe sheer scope of this movie is aweinspiring the world of arrakis unfolds with such meticulous detail and grand scale that you feel fully immersed in this alien yet starkly beautiful setting the visual effects are nothing short of mindblowing from the majesty of the colossal sandworms to the intricate spectacle of futuristic battles each frame is a masterclass in cinematic artistrybut its not just a visual feast the story in part two takes a bolder more complex turn the political intrigue intensifies the stakes feel impossibly high and the depths of paul atreides destiny are plumbed in ways that are both thrilling and deeply thoughtprovoking while the film is grand and epic it skillfully balances spectacle with profound character moments and a plot laden with themes of prophecy power and the consequences of choiceif you were a fan of the first dune prepare to be blown away if youre a lover of cinema itself this film is an absolute mustsee,positive
710,dune part was only the beginning where the first part sets the tone and foundation for the story and themes the second part elevates the story visuals design soundtrack cgi characters and every other aspect into another stratosphere its a perfect second part of the dune trilogy a war movie with neverseenbefore shots combined with the story and characters the story continues even stronger than in the first part especially the build up to the final showdown leaves room for specilation and interpretation the holy war just begand and with burn the whole galaxy dune part ist cinema at its best visually story and character wise and just overall,positive
711,this movie is a huge stepup to the first instalment it is the very movie the cinema industry needs at this current slum in film qualitytake madame web for example a result of poor production and corrupt admin the movie is worse than horrible because its been flushed out of production with no second thought purely so the investors can take their bag and move ondune is quite literally the complete opposite of this the developers have a deep connection to the source material and their devotion is crystal cleardune part is a culmination of hard work dedication commitment and the proper use of narrative storytelling and structure there are no points in this movie where one may fall asleep which was where the first movie fell offthe way in which the movie has been structured and presented allows the viewer to completely immerse themselves making them feel like they are within the world of dune itself watching events play out as a warrior along pauls side or one of his religious fanaticsthe movie in most senses actually moves too fast which may hurt the interpretation of whats presented because most moviegoers are far too used to the poor and eyecandy structure of most current action films but nonetheless if you pay proper attention and try your best to understand you probably willon a side note this movie couldnt have achieved what it has without its predecessor many have forgotten what happened in the first instalment because of its failure to properly entertain the audience but after breaking down the first film you can see the dependance the sequel has to the first filmone last point this movie would not be the achievement that it is without its stunningly beautiful use of soundtrack and cgithis film goes above and beyond in the way it integrates the music with narrative tension and overall impact it would not have been as jawdropping without hanz zimmers stier performance and love of composition should i even mention how well he immerses himself into the films universe to produce such fitting and unique soundadditionally this film stands as a manual on how to properly use cgi and stage control it goes against the current methods of using animation to please the eye and yet showed us things more stunning and impactful than the poorly rendered scenes presented by studios such as marvel and sony that everyone seems to appreciate way too muchcontrol over production is control over impact,positive
712,i dont know what are these reviews about but for me dune part and are just mediocre stunning cinematography and direction sound designmusic costumesactors etc but somehow still feels empty i dont care for a single one character on the screen i was bored in both of the movies too long to watch and in my opinion never delivers my expectations i dont know what is the issue here but the movie doesnt have identity all character are irrelevant and the develpoment and scenario are absent didnt have good time watching both of these so i would recommend guys just skip it felt just waste of money for me,negative
713,i really do miss such movies had to rewatch part before watching this and im glad i did the storyline the actors the effects the music the sound the creaturesboy i could go on and on and on in case you are searching for something worth watching i would suggest this but kindly do watch the part first even if you have kindly rewatch it to grasp the entire story in dune we see leaders who actually occupy seats of power and we see those who control them just like any political system in any country its an all out war for power who controls the essential resources controls it all we get a glimpse of how faith works in people theres a lot to this if you keep an open mind and im definitely going to have to rewatch this again simply epic,positive
714,see in dolby vision not imax im not sure why so many people prefer a bigger screen to dolby vision hdr and e theater room built for dolby atmosi dont go to the theater much anymore because i generally prefer my recently acquired lg signature class oled evo m which was a significant investment but felt the same about my gas a huge fan of the book i knew it would be basically impossible to capture all aspects of the storyline but felt the s film did a much better job of explaining essential plot lines and mysticreligious undertones and personal struggles for several main characters that were so important to the book but barely touched on glossed over or completely omitted even though this production had more than hours over two films to take the time to explore them had i not read the book several times i would have felt completely lost watching both films in the theater i thought the pacing and action made this sequel a bit more exciting for anyone who had never read the book but i had to see it twice because i spent much of my first viewing explaining missing elements that tied the overall plot together so that it made sense to themthe visuals and cinematography are grand in scale and mind blowing though and make the s movie look as low budget as a modern indie film and the soundtrack and was so amazing it was like it was as much of a character as the actors themselves though initially taken aback by some of the major plot changes they did lessen my enjoyment of the moviespoilersproblems i had as such a huge fan of the book the harkonnens never seemed quite menacing enough or as much of a threat as they were in the book and their defeat seemed much too easy they came across more as menacing bafoons it was never explained just how important spice was and why it was the only way to travel instantly cross the universe and the harkonnens were so wealthy and powerful because of it the importance of the relationship between timothy chalomet and his mother as well as his relationship to zendaya fell short of how important they were in the book the different religious themes of the book were greatly undermined to make the movie almost entirely political but since religion is being phased out of our secular world why not phase it out of fictional books right timothy chalomets performance and transformation from the beginning of the first film to the end of the second was impressive to watch which is a testament to his artistry as an actor but the film left out a lot of the training and studying of both his physical skills and knowledge made that transition seem much easier for him in both films than they were in the book but i understand time constraintsmany of these issues have been addressed in other reviews so i wont go onthe beauty and music of this movie were a masterpiece of cinematography lighting sound and an awe inspiring soundtrack though i harper on several things in my review i thoroughly enjoyed the film especially the nd time when i could simply watch it without constantly answering questions from friends who were completely lost amongst the am a ting visuals i imagine i will enjoy it more with future viewings at home and i feel this sequel was much better and entertaining than the first which is why i gave it a good rating but find it far from the masterpiece others have called it i preferred blade runner to dune and would reserve masterpiece to the lord of the rings trilogy extended cuts mcus infiniti saga which has mostly gone down hill since and the chosen series the foundation series alien and aliens extended cuts and the entire star wars saga including mandalorian and the other side movies and tv series just to give you an idea of my tastes i would include both blade runners as masterpieces and considering ive watched mad max atomic blonde and ex machina well over a dozen times i might venture to call them masterpieces but not dune,positive
715,mr villeneuve must have scored a big payday on this one but there are clear indications that he relinquished creative control to do so or to put it in oldfashioned terms sold his soul his work when unhindered is much more mature and i can only imagine what he would have served us given free reinhis hand is still detected in the visuals cinematography set and costume design thats what those two stars have purchased maybe there should be another half a star for rebecca ferguson the only actor who earned their salary in the film the remainder of the cast can be summed up as two entitled spoiled young people acting like entitled spoiled young people surrounded by slightly more mature adults who try half heartedly to take it all seriously you can see on occasion a glint in the eye of josh brolin or javier braden trying to stifle giggles when timothy or that funny z girl scream in rage or brood but maybe the thought of all the dollars pouring into their bank account helped restrain the mirthits easy to get carried away by the splendid graphics but at heart a good film is characterized by brilliance in acting and storytelling and this film has neitherperverting the source material in favour of modern narratives is likewise a major flaw i wonder how much longer we will have such crimes inflicted upon us classics are classics for a reason its not a complex reason its really simple a great many people have enjoyed and been inspired by them so they endure when you change the source material it becomes weak or anemic and dies pretty soon after by dies i mean people lose interest in it quicklywhatever popularity the two part dune remake is enjoying is due to being the least bad thing out there on the silver screen thats a very low bar,positive
716,the movie is just perfect in every level just a cinematic experience at its bestdo watch it in theaters a must watch moviethe cinematography and production design are breathtaking showcasing the harsh beauty of arrakis and other worlds with incredible detailperformances by timothe chalamet zendaya and austin butler best performancesdirector villeneuves confident handling of the complex political and philosophical themes of frank herberts novel while still a long film the improved pacing makes it a more engaging and propulsive experience than the firstdune part two offers a satisfying payoff to the setup of part one raising the stakes and delivering a thrilling and emotionally resonant story,positive
717,what an experience i left my mm screening on the premier in leicester square london absolutely buzzing this is the first review ive done of a film and i couldnt think of something that deserves it morehaving been a fan of the books and franchise for a long time denis villeneuve does not hold back the pacing is perfect despite the run time of three hours it does not feel longed out unlike for instance the hobbitit would be an understatement to say this film is brought alive by the excellent music of hans zimmer and his crew the perfect blend of his craft with the imagination of denis villeneuve creates the most breathtaking visuals and an experience to remember,positive
718,this is it guysthats the landmark movie of the st century i want to begin by highlighting that this is not a movie its a whole experience supposing you see it in the big screen the whole room vibrating the score the perspective of denis the seat movement happening because of the sound shattering vibrations its really a whole new experience which i hope sets the standard for all movies and directors to come i want everyone reading this review to understand that this experience was closer to a simulation rather than a movie you will literally never witness something like it if you dont see it on the big screenlastly i want to praise denis villeneuve even if you are not a cinema enthusiast and even if you dont care for things such as the art of directing a movie the work denis has done cannot go unnoticed i am referring to everyone even if you dont know what directing means or the different directing techniques you will find yourself completely understanding the directing perspective leaving the room speechless at the endmark your calendars people movie history was made in,positive
719,i went to the cinema early today to see dune part partly because i couldnt wait past release date but also i anticipated the film would take time to sink in and i could let it do that whilst i ate lunchi was not disappointed in the slightest in fact this wonderful film exceeded expectationsi did find myself distracted from time to time comparing scenes in this film against the version such as you young pup these distractions were few far between and reassuringly made right at every occasion in this filmit was clear that the added time over two films that the version didnt have gave opportunity to dv to cover almost everything the book has to offera feast for the eyes and the ears simply a great return to big screen cinema more like this would tempt me back to a limitless card ball is on your court hollywood make more of this and take my money,positive
720,dune part two continues the epic saga set in the vast and intricate universe crafted by frank herbert building upon the foundation laid in the first installment this sequel delves even deeper into the political intrigue religious undertones and philosophical complexities that define the dune universe director denis villeneuve masterfully navigates the narrative seamlessly blending stunning visuals with profound storytelling the desert landscapes of arrakis are as aweinspiring as ever evoking a sense of both beauty and danger timothe chalamet reprises his role as paul atreides delivering a nuanced performance that captures the characters inner conflict and burgeoning power the ensemble cast including zendaya rebecca ferguson and oscar isaac each shine in their respective roles adding depth and dimension to the story one of the standout aspects of the movie is its exploration of the mystical elements introduced in the first film the bene gesserit sisterhood and their manipulation of bloodlines the prophetic visions of the fremen and the enigmatic nature of the sandworms all contribute to the rich tapestry of the dune universe the film also delves deeper into the themes of destiny sacrifice and the consequences of wielding power as paul atreides grapples with his newfound abilities and the weight of his familys legacy he is forced to confront difficult choices that will shape the fate of the galaxy villeneuves direction is both grandiose and intimate capturing the epic scale of the story while also delving into the personal struggles of its characters the action sequences are pulsepounding and visually stunning but it is the quieter moments of introspection and dialogue that truly resonate hans zimmers score once again elevates the film immersing the audience in the world of dune with its haunting melodies and epic orchestration overall this movie is a triumph of storytelling and spectacle a worthy continuation of the beloved saga that will leave audiences eagerly awaiting the next chapter with its breathtaking visuals compelling performances and thoughtprovoking themes it solidifies denis villeneuves place as one of the most visionary directors working today,positive
721,dune part gave me a spiritual experiencenow i previously had a similar experience with dune part one but dune part two has taken things to a whole other leveli am struggling to put into words how incredible dune part two was i have never before seen a movie that has managed to make me feel this way hans zimmers soundtrack transported me into another realm i seriously cannot understate how incredible this soundtrack was throughout the entire film it was giving me chills the cinematography acting script was absolutely ruthless timothee chalamets performance was brutal and incredibly depicted pauls fury and ascent to power the wide panning shots of the desert coupled with hans zimmers orchestra was breathtaking the almost rhythmic battle between the fremen and the harkonnens was phenomenal this is a movie that not only respects the source material and the scifi genre but that creates an almost religious lens through which to experience simultaneously the multifaceted complexities of story telling through film and of the dune saga i cannot put into words the complete and utter state of awe i am in right now after coming out of that cinema i genuinely felt like i just had a spiritual experience and i am not nor have i ever been a spiritual or religious person,positive
722,first off havent read the books really enjoyed the first moviesecondly it looks and sounds greatbut for a movie that was in length it feels like half the movie was left on the cutting floor i dont know if it has been designed specifically for book readers and thats why so much detail seems to have been glossed over or what but while the first movie felt like it fit everything in that it needed to the second felt like it left half of it outit felt a lot like justice league to me when you watch the first release youre left thinking where the rest of the movie is and then you watch the hour version and you end up with a pretty good movie this one feels like it should have been twice as longyou spend the first hour basically jumping from test to test and incredibly forced and chemistry less romance we get no understanding of pauls mothers intentions or desire we basically get a north vs south for believers and nonbelievers but no continuation of the mythology around which they believe we basically get one scene to explain the ineptitude of the current ruler of the planet and some even less informative scenes to reveal our new villain no politicking of why the emperor did what he did other than pauls dad was weak in the emperors eyes we get no understanding into the strategy of either army outside a second scene that is basically to explain to us because its mostly just going to be sand when the main fight happens why are the harkonnens so stupid after being led to believe they were clever and scheming in the first movieit felt like the director had a list of scenes he wanted in the movie and didnt really care how he got between them or if people understood why things were happening like what the heck is the blue juice outside being wyrm piss thats about as close as we get to what it is we get none of the visions that he apparently hasreally wanted to love this one ended up finding it both too long and too short really feels like it should have taken its time to genuinely explain and establish everything would have much preferred hours to achieve that or even two parts hours way better rather than the feeling that half the movie had to be cut out,positive
723,this is my first review ive ever written ive never been compelled enough by any film before to share my thoughtsive seen so many attempts at portraying moral ambiguity and painting characters in shades of gray but they always ended up looking flat and ultimately me not caring about them for the first time someone managed to tell a gray story and make it thrilling i ended up rooting for paul and hating myself every second for doing so beautifulultimately what this film chooses not to say is the most powerful and amongst the epic battle scenes the moments of silence are what truly captured me,positive
724,as a film unconnected to the book its a great spectacle with good production values and performances as a representation of the book its much poorer than lynchs version villeneuve seems to have written his own story barely paying lipservice to herberts original compressing timelines foresaking all the political subtlety and omitingsome characters completely in an attempt to bring drama and conflict to relationships which dont really need them if there is a sequel it will no doubt be even further from the original villeneuve seems to have proved this book is unfilmable at least by him lord of the rings this aint,positive
725,timothe body is like a skeleton same old boring story about the good vs evil everybody is so serious looking in every scene the cast is hollywood red carpet in one movie lea seydoux as a witch austin elvis butler as a bad guy with a offcouse a very low evil voice the movie is almost hour long and its the same things happening the hole time zendaya is very serious the story telling is very bad why is this happening who are they the blue holy water of life is from a wormone star goes to hans zimmer for the music and the speciel effects team on the set,negative
726,if you hated dune because it was boring this movie makes it interesting every scene is action packed with tangible pay offs that give you an ohhhh moment it does justice to the original work making effective changes that help both onscreen adaption and modernizing the themes if you liked the first or the books it is absolutely a must seeeven if you havent watched dune this movie is incredible i came in knowing nothing of the dune lore i didnt even know who paul was i am a fan of well done world building and explosions and this movie delivered the plot is simple allowing any viewer to jump in and become immersed in the world of dune the themes are easy to engage with but not gratuitous every character captures your attention within seconds on screen i was drooling over the costumes the acting is incredible as well not a single complaint to be hadi had a hard time deciphering what was practical and cgi everything looks incredible by far the best set design ever put on screen it gets a little long but youre so enthralled it doesnt even matter even the theoretical baby stuff is digestible and makes the story all the more interestingmy only recommendation is bring ear plugs because you will be deaf if you see it in theaters,positive
727,villeneuve is an utter genius this film is absolutely remarkable in so many ways the visuals are drenched in excellence and it makes the experience magicalfor an almost three hour movie you do feel the length at moments but it is all necessary to tell the story properly a story which can seem so impossible to pull from herberts book but yet is done masterfullythe cast is excellent with the exception of one being a miscast i love christopher walken but it was hard to not internally laugh at his iconic voice during the filmhans zimmer of course delivers again though part ones score had stronger momentsdune part one and part two is no doubt the science fiction grand epic of the s,positive
728,dune part has arrived and my good god what an astounding spectacle it is denis villeneuve warmed up the tracks with his superb but exposition heavy first part but with this second instalment he and that magnificent hans zimmer pull the collective ripcord on stunning large scale set pieces devastating emotional beats detailed visual world building and jaw dropping cinematic undertakings timothee chalamet finally gains a much needed edge to his acting vernacular his paul atreides metamorphosing from timid sheltered introvert prince into fearless and often frightening messiah in the making is a staggering turn stellan skarsgard continues his masterclass in obese understated villainy as evil baron harkonnen javier bardem takes up comic relief duty in the films very welcome and most surprisingly playful performance austin butler is pure unbridled feral fury josh brolin gritty and graceful as ever florence pugh stately and pragmatic rebecca ferguson turns up the intensity to unbearable levels as her characters arc takes a menacing turn while christopher walken a fascinating bold yet strangely appropriate choice for the emperor of the entire universe downplays his unmistakable energy to fit the space opera atmosphere the films best performance goes to zendaya though her desert warrior princess chani is a captivating character respite with rough resilience tender resolve and bruised vulnerability when certain heartbreaking plot revelations unfold shes perfect everything that was just beginning to fire up in the first film is roaring on full blast here the battles are sensational tactile ballets of machinery in motion explosive projectiles obliterating spice harvesters lithely ruthless hand to hand combat invigorating rides atop the immense sand worms complete with immersive pov shots and enough super sonic sound design to make you actually believe you are there the emotional resonance is present too amidst all the beautiful chaos of battle a heros journey that could easily spill into intergalactic horror if wrong choices are made and ill favoured destinies are followed this is what movies were made to be a colossally huge epic that doesnt forget to be smart detailed meticulously written and teeming with creativity great film,positive
729,the film is a masterpiece flawlessly executed with a meticulous attention to detail earning a perfect score of it defies description the director demonstrates an unparalleled mastery of his craft truly a magician at work in my estimation it stands as the pinnacle of cinematic achievement thus far i was enveloped in goosebumps from start to finish particularly when experienced on the grand scale of imax or a comparable venue truly enhancing its immersive qualities as a cinematic spectacle the performances by the cast were nothing short of exceptional each earning a perfect rating of for their contributions to the films brilliance,positive
730,i wasnt aware of the books until dune part came out and now having seen dune part it just amazes me that what we are seeing and experiencing came out of ones imagination and years of research and brain scratching watch this film on the biggest screen possiblefood for thought while watching dune part i realized that this is not entirely a revenge saga it includes many layers of conflict and different ideologies but the thing is the books came out in s back then these complex stories hardly adapted into movies only later an average revenge flick became a thing to write something of this magnitude is such an astounding feat,positive
731,i have never actually published a reviewrating on a movie prior to this but after having seen it i simply just had too i have watched a couple of movies of different sorts many of which i truly enjoyed but this this was different when i sat in my seat watching this movie unfold before my very eyes i was left flabbergasted i genuinely got goosebumps like times watching this movie and it felt as if i entered a state of nirvana towards the end of it i have never gotten such a feeling from watching a movie before this was truly sensational and mindblowing in every way possible im in awe,positive
732,i think everyone has just come to expect complete hack written formulaic garbage from hollywood to the extent that when something good does come out its treated like its the maudib of moviesthe first movie felt like a beautiful hour trailer in part there was obviously a great deal more development and yet there were several pockets of the movie that just felt like a waste of time when things were happening they felt rushed and undersold and when they werent they just dragged onfor example pauls pre born sister alia felt wildly underwhelming and shes one of the biggest reveals of the books i also felt like villeneuve left maybe a bit too much on the cutting room table part felt oddly grated the violence was largely bloodless like a marvel movie and intimate scenes were shot from the shoulders updune is far more adult than that personally thats what ive been thirsting for a movie like this made for adultsperformances were by and large well donechalamet turns in his usual subdued but strong performancezendaya seems a little out of place this time around now that she actually had a role rather than only being in visions she mostly reminded me of an angry year old boyjavier bardem and his fanatical stilgar were great and once he becomes a believer you can see bardem really start to have funrebecca ferguson is still by far the strongest actor in this series every shot shes in you just dont blink shes absolutely mesmerizingjosh brolin does his josh brolin thing serves his purposeaustin butler you can tell puts alot of work into his roles he does well hereflorence pugh is more like furniture to me like everything ive seen her in i know shes there but im not really paying attention to her in oppenheimer i realized i was ignoring her when she was on screen and i wasnt even doing it on purposewhich leads me to my problems with this cut of the film pugh and christopher walken just felt emptythere wasnt enough time spent trying to understand them less broll of the desert and maybe more focus on character development would have been goodwhy would the emperor kill pauls father who was like a son to him i know they explained it but it didnt feel enough i didnt know or care enough about the character or his motivations to feel genuine even if his reasons were manufactured by a certain group and exacerbated by his own pettiness fear and jealousy this is a movie this is show not tellwith all of that being said dune part is by far the best thing to come out of hollywood in years which is why people are freaking out like its the nd coming were so deprived of quality and not original but fresh filmmaking that well worship anything decentoppenheimer made a billyyes bc it was tied to barbie and that was literally nothing but people talking for hours in different rooms were desperate,positive
733,not a word i use lightly but for the first time in years i was sat in the cinema and gave no thought to anything other than the film it absolutely demands your focus and rewards you for supplying itother than leaving you desperately wanting more there are no negatives to write aboutthe positives are myriad the visual effects the sound design the acting the story all impeccable there are so many moments of stress but just as many of triumph you will experience the catharsis of the characters as intensely as they feel iti cant wait for the inevitable supercut that combines this and the first film as they could have seamlessly blended them into an over hour epic,positive
734,hate to say this but dune part feels like a film made by committee stamped and approved by studio executives and bogged down in budgetary constraints the first film set up so many glorious avenues each picking up threads laid out in the book the sequel jettisons many of these in favor of new storylines that diminish herberts original vision gone are the meditative bears from the original and in its place are marvelized action set pieces and down the middle dialogue exchanges zero talk of the spacing guild the true villains of the original and instead they made the bene gesserits the architects of disaster why felt wrong on many levels sad end to a strong beginning,positive
735,half the lovie is in the dark the character have a terrible voice and everyone looks angry the plot is full of holes and incomprehensible the leader is no leader incredibly stupid all appearance and not content one of the worst movie i ever sawplot the plot revolves a struggle for power between two noble housesthe atreides and harkonnenscentered on the desert planet of arrakis which is the only known source of the spice the most valuable substance in the universe because it is necessary for interstellar navigation and also greatly extends human lifespan paul atreides brcomes the leader of the fremen because they believe he his the messiah to proof himself he rides a giant worm and drinks the water of life which is blue piss worm in the end he defeats the bad guys but the great house refuse to recognize him so he start a holy war against them to follow in part to avoid at allcost,negative
736,phenomenal from start to finish i was absolutely taken aback by the sheer production value the acting will sweep all awards action and suspense that will leave you on the edge of your seat a battle of decisions that hold such weight time after time i had chills from a beautiful shot or a moving line the cinematography is something that will be looked at as the peak for a long time my expectations and hopes were high then i saw great reviews so my expectations got even higher yet they were still surpass best experience perfect scene after scene after scene thank you so much to all involved who took us in the amazing story of dune and created the masterpiece,positive
737,an amazing story telling camera work just spectacular storyline true to the book and those who read the series know how complicated the plot line is yet the movie managed to convey most of it truthfully and with not much straying from herberts ideas i went in with very high expectations and i am happy to say they were met a very long movie yes but totally worth seeing a much better adaptation than version in my eyes the director managed to make the storyline more contemporarily relevant and even though it is very dark and terrifying at times it portrays dangers of todays or any days religious extreme fanatyzm very clearly,positive
738,we have been starved and deprived of good quality movies these last couple of yearshollywood and its soulless companies like wokisney have spent billions on box checking politics social politics and other nonsense onto our screens only for it to blow up in their faces listen to your customers and what they want we want a good story plot and escape the daytoday issuesthankfully dune part is here to bring the balance back no box ticking just good acting based on peoples ability and to be immersed in a storydune part is excellent great acting the complex situation of pauls path and the politics involved with his choicesthe downside is we will have to wait for part and i want it now,positive
739,dune part two absolutely blew me away for years i thought adapting frank herberts masterpiece was a fools errand but then denis villeneuve stepped in and let me tell you the mans a visionary hes a master worldbuilder and the one hes created for dune is simply unparalleled every detail from the harsh beauty of arrakis to the intricate designs of the fremen culture feels meticulously crafted and utterly believable the casting is spoton too each actor embodies their character perfectly bringing depth and nuance to even the most minor roles and lets not forget the action the explosions are heartstoppingly real the fight choreography is topnotch and every battle sequence is a visceral thrill ride dune part two is a masterclass in filmmaking a rich and immersive experience that leaves you wanting desperately for more part three cant come soon enough,positive
740,dune part two a review spoilerfreeheres a spoilerfree review of dune part twovisually stunning the film continues the breathtaking visuals from part one immersing audiences in the vast landscapes of arrakis and the grandeur of its cultures director denis villeneuves vision shines through creating a visually stunning experiencedeeper exploration part two delves deeper into the complex world of dune exploring the fremen culture and their struggles against the oppressive harkonnens it also delves further into paul atreides journey and the burdens of his potential futurestronger focus on characters the relationships between characters particularly paul and chani are given more focus in this film the performances especially from timothe chalamet and zendaya are powerful and captivatingactionpacked sequences while not an actionheavy film part two delivers intense and wellchoreographed action sequences particularly when the fremen face off against their enemiesnot a standalone film its important to note that part two is the second half of a larger story while it builds on the first film and offers a satisfying conclusion to its specific arc it also sets the stage for a potential third filmoverall dune part two is a visually stunning and narratively engaging film that builds upon the foundation laid by part one it offers a deeper exploration of the characters and world while delivering both action and emotional resonance however viewers unfamiliar with the first film or the source material might find it challenging to fully grasp the complexities of the story,positive
741,truly amazing i have no words it was the sequel that not only we so deeply wanted but also desperately needed it follows a journey of discovery power the rising of a true leader lisan al gaib creating his own path leading towards the green paradise i simply cannot wait to see what the director has in store for the ending of such an epic story paul has grown a lot and his evolution is clearly visible throughout the whole duration of the moviethe entire setting was just fantastic the music the scenery the action it really kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time one might think that hours is a lot but so much happened during this time that i didnt even noticei will be waiting with great enthusiasm the return of muaddib for everything seems uncertain now many new questions have risen and challenges have yet to be completed war is not over,positive
742,if you are a fan of the book you will probably be disappointed with the movie the reason the spice is so valuable has been completely ignored and the screenwriters took it upon themselves to create a new story that has similarities to the book dunebefore lord of the rings was released i thought that hollywood couldnt do the book justice but peter jackson did a magnificent job of lord of the ringsvilleneuve has hacked a great book into a typical hollywood formulaic movie with non of the imaginative ideas that made dune such a great bookthe acting was good the effects were good pity about the lack of a coherent story,positive
743,part one killer no fillerpart two what the too many big departures from the bookpart two felt like it needed to be wrapped up by the end and that the studio dont wanna bank on part three also the script in parts was woeful teenage stuff i also think it could have been trimmed a little in the editing department it felt flabby to methat all said there were some great elements the costumes are next level good zimmers score is incredible the cinematography is grandplease let there be a directors cut for this id love to see villeneuves unencumbered cut no doubt it would be more in line with part one,positive
744,anyone who has read the breathtakingly detailed and dramatically written books by frank herbert knows that every film would need minimum hours of running timebut to integrate herberts language of the fremen chakobsa to put all the love the producers and all their teams and characters invested in the details creating this breathtaking movie is rare and best of that frank herberts son is co producer represents the deep believe in that epic thememovie projectnot to forget the spectacular soundtrackpart two is unexpectedly well implemented i hope for many oscarspatrice vermette is for sure good again forif you like the films you should definitely read volumes,positive
745,so i have read the books watched the previous miniseries and played the many games over the years and i can tell you one thing its a good could even be great sifi movies but they failed at the story the visuals are great the score is amazing the designetc but the story was just not there they missed and changed many details that are imperative to the story for example where does the spice come from why does it matter where is the spacing guild why dont they have computers in the future why would the universe stand still if something happened to its supply how did the fremen manage to beat those armies especially the dune sardaukar and what about alia and her whole arch the thing is without going into much details how can they take this to cover the rest of the story children of dune god emperor of dunei felt disappointed by the middle of that movie and it just felt like the last season of got all over again so bottom line if you know nothing about this story you will enjoy it and could be a in your book for me i can give it a or out of at best,positive
746,first movie here is why this one is in no particular orderstilgar reduced to a clownthe barron reduced to a inconsequential backgroundhalf of the movie was people mostly women of course staring meanly at the camerathe other half was weak inconsequential dialogue of no substance ie genius we are melting rock on them says the barron completely out of character and for no reason at allthe pacing felt choppythe direction felt aimless as if two different people directed the two partsthe visual gravity of scenes mismatched the gravity of the soundtrack numerous timesgirl power antisouth and mah equality moments for no reasonthree of pauls key scenes were carbon copies of daenerys scenes from game of thrones season and etc etc bad character work,negative
747,this movie was amazing i loved it so much florence did so good it was a very good intro to her part o gosh timothe was so good but austin was my favorite character in this movie i love him in general he is a very kind guy but in the movie he really plays his part well he is a very bad guy a bloodthirsty villain and honestly i went to see the movie to see him because i am a big fan but when i saw it he was bald like he looks so different without hair hahaha this movie was a huge upgrade from the first one because it wasnt as exciting and very confusing if u havent read the book zendaya was so good i love her character and everything but anyway definitely my fav movie ever,positive
748,from the music to the acting directing the way its shot the writing the special effects everything about dune is perfect the best experience i have ever had in a cinema was watching this movie it is easily the best movie of the s so far in a time where most movies look cheap have poor acting writing and directing dune shines as an example of what a movie can be after watching it for the first time i found myself completely obsessed for a long time pauls actions as many people point out are morally questionable but he is extremely entertaining to watch austin butler as feud rautha is an absolute scene stealer he like everyone else in the movie delivers a fenomenal performance more than that he was probably the best in the whole movie dune is incredible in every way i would recommend it to anyone,positive
749,captivating spectacular full of emotionthis film shows us that great films can still be made when everyone dedicates themselves to the projectdune part two hits in almost every aspect that a movie demands the action is not at all rushed everything is linear and flows fluently but it takes care to pull you aside for a dose of surprisethe story goes in a direction that i thought they could not reach without touching the clichs that we have become accustomed to from the industry in recent years but with a good construction it shows us that we can see the film as more than a film we can see it as a real world but beyond our own which starts as soon as we start the movie and ends when we finish it leaving us with thoughts and ideas for a long time afterwardsnow leaving the introduction aside lets talk about the sand the first part of dune seemed to me a cheap caricature full of classic hollywood ingredients to get money out of the massesi didnt want to watch this movie especially after the trailer that seemed to me like another parody my mistake someone needs to be fired but i said id give it a chance and the movie far exceeded my humble expectationsthe first film explained nothing and said nothing but this one makes everything clear if at the beginning of the first part we only had famous actors who were put in front of camera just to say two or three sentences only to leave the frame moments after and never return now we have the joy of seeing how the characters develop and come to life in this space scifi worldas far as actors are concerned i never liked timothee chalament hes not a bad actor i just dont like how he act because he always seems like a little girl who ran out of buffers but in this movie he does a monumental work with his characteri could say that he gave life to paul atreides and became what any good actor should become his own character frank herbert would have been proud i thinki liked the direction where character went i saw a little darkness in his eyes after the second half of the movie which reminds me of anakin skywalker for a moment im curious where he will go with this thing maybe something evil is coming that would put pressure on him but it would bring him a lot of success if he plays it wellas for the secondary characters rebecca ferguson as princess jessica does a good job you can finally say that she is acting and its scares you how good she isjavier bardem as stilgar is the soul of this film although there are some scenes and moments when he seems to be forced to say or do something thing that takes him out of character but hey the yearold kids who watche the movie must laugh toojosh brolin returns as gurney halleck and does it in style offers an extra dose of energy and has a part in the story its not just a decorationstellan skarsgard as baron vladimir does an insane job just like in the first partzendaya plays chani well she has good lines and a pleasant interpretationand the last but not the forgetten austin butler who kills it into the role of feydrautha i wished to see more of him but as much as he was he brought his contribution to the filmthe rest of the casting made a small but vital contribution every person involved in this project deserves praise and appreciation they made everything possibleregarding the technique the film is shot in color and in black and white depending on the environment which i liked the frames are interesting and full of lightthe fight scenes are well done although in some cases they could be extended or at least worked on a bit morethe director of the film denis villeneuve brings something nice to world cinema not necessarily revolutionary but he shows us that if you have imagination creativity a little brain and a safe of money you can make a movie that will be remembered decades from nowhans zimmer strikes perfectly with his music which seems for my personal pleasures to be one of the best aspects of the film along with color acting and the fight scenesin conclusion the film leaves us with the obvious conclusion that a third part follows i dont know what denis intends to do with it i know what i would do if i were in his place but if he takes it in the right direction he could make dune a new trilogy to receive a special place among the other glorious trilogies created over the years such as the trilogy lord of the rings batman dark knight star wars episode pirates of the caribbean the first three parts only the rest does not exist i hope we remember this future trilogy as an example of how art is made and offer it as a lesson for the following films and movie makersill only give it stars because as i said before some fight scenes and some details could be worked on the dialogue has a few slips sometimes and it take the light away but overall its more than perfect i guess frank herbert would be proud of what they do after his booksif you are a fan of action movies with handtohand combat explosions a good story and a carousel of emotions to go through then watch this movie because it gives you everything you wantif not watch the movie at least you will be entertained,positive
750,this movie is officially the new bar by which scifi is measured it is well written executed acted and plotted i am not sure there is a scifi epic that approaches this the closest may be a space odyssey or blade runner but even then this is a step apart and in its own league if you havent seen it you must go see itthis was a perfect sequel to denis part one it accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar performances and visuals that most films only dream of havingim excited for dune now and will be looking forward to that as well,positive
751,to see a successor so good that it almost outshine its predecessor is rare last time i saw this happen was with the dark knight i dont want it to be another dark knight because i want dune to ascend even beyond this but the bar is set just too highthrough the movie characters are given more depth new ones are introduced there motivations are shown and yet we cannot simply say who to root for all characters have their own sets of dynamics and even the simplest of lines in part are given a grand entry in part the visionary director once again succeeded in providing some new breathtaking visuals and too see hans zimmer give another great musical is just the cherry on top you needoverall its a great movie and a great successor to dune the scale is set too high but i know the director will have something new waiting for us in part as well,positive
752,one word spectacularthis is truly a cinematic masterpiece to be witnessed in a big screen the visuals of first movie were impressive but this one even better every cast member did amazing job this is not an average sci fi where in every scene some ka boom action is going on but in every scene is important to the plotline the fighting techniques were so unique and the music by hans zimmer gives chills my favorite character is lady essica played by rebecca ferguson timothee chalamet was wonderful his transition from a boy prince to a leader was fantastic zendaya was amazing as well the third act of the movie was brilliant can not wait for the next installment,positive
753,dune part two continues to mesmerize with its stunning visual effects capturing the aweinspiring landscapes of arrakis and the grandeur of interstellar conflict from the towering sandworms to the sweeping vistas of the desert every frame is a testament to the films visual prowess dont let the runtime scare you away while dune part two delivers an epic and immersive experience its runtime may test the patience of some viewers clocking in at over two hours the film delves deep into its narrative occasionally slowing down the pace however for fans of epic scifi and intricate storytelling the films expansive worldbuilding and compelling characters make it a worthwhile journey overall dune part two is a sweeping epic that delves into the heart of frank herberts beloved universe with its captivating story stunning visuals and stellar cast its a worthy continuation of the saga that will leave audiences eagerly anticipating the next installment i hope there is a third installment that finish outs this initial story ive read that this is akin to star wars in theaters i highly encourage you to see this at the movies the visuals really are fantastic and the cast shines as always stars out of,positive
754,i was really looking forward to the sequel but left the cinema disappointedin my opinion too much time was spent on character and relationships at the beginning of the film making the ending feel too shortthey turned stilgar into a clown so that the majority in the cinema could laughof course there are many inaccuracies and deviations from the book but thats acceptabletrying to capture all events and characters in a threehour film is impossiblethe most unpleasant thing was observing chanis behavior no matter how villeneuve justified it it spoiled the overall impression of the film,positive
755,dune is a rare gem of a film in that it accomplishes to expand upon the immense scale of its predecessor while also giving us a truly intimate connection with the trials of the characters within it its a technological marvel breathing a much needed breath of fresh air to an industry thats been drowning in bloated budget action movies that fail to offer more than tired trends and tropesthe sound design alone left me with goosebumps at times hearing sounds that had textures i never knew were possible in cinema it makes me hopefully for the future of the art that is cinemai left the theater feeling as i did as a kid as if i had just witnessed something truly awe inspiring,positive
756,i really dont get the hypedune world in the books and even the miniseries is a world full of politics subplots many characters dv part was only about paul every other character in the movie becomes onedimensional lady jessica a complete villain the emperor a weak character cheni a constantly annoyed girlfriend stilgar from leader to a blind follower irulan boring rabban a loser spacing guild is completely missing and there is not even a mention why spice is so important a compleximmersive world was turned only to a personal story of paul becoming the messiah miniseries did it better with of the budget battle feels rushed significant changes to the book have been changed and key people are missingobviously there is huge production value but plot being so watereddown made it a miss for meif you can get pass the low budget just watch the miniseries,positive
757,the first movie i was excited about because i thought it did well in tracking with frank hurberts book this second part looks like they said to hell with the book and they changed up the whole dynamic of the story to the extent that they have abandoned a lot of the concepts from the book in favor of current day politics and conceptions i am very disappointed i had to wait until it came out on video to watch it and minutes in i dont even recognize it because even when they use elements from the book it is so turned around and distorted what a waste of do yourself a favor and read the book,negative
758,wow just wow dune part two is nothing short of a scififantasy marvel if you thought the first part was good get ready to be blown away denis villeneuve has truly outdone himself delivering a film that stands tall among the greatest epics of our timefrom start to finish the movie is an absolute visual feast the worldbuilding is second to none and the plot keeps you hooked with its perfectly paced story and jawdropping climax villeneuves direction is impeccable making him a true master of the genre its no wonder even christopher nolan praised this filmtimothe chalamet shines as paul atreides embodying the role with charisma and depth zendaya has more screen time and she nails it while austin butler is chilling as the villain rebecca ferguson gives one of the best performances of the year and javier bardem adds a surprising touch of humor the cast is stellar each actor bringing their agamehans zimmers score is pure genius elevating every scene to new heights the technical aspects vfx sound editing are all topnotch and worthy of every award out there the action sequences are mindblowing sending chills down my spinewhat i love most is how this film stands on its own sure watching the first part helps but dune part two is a selfcontained masterpiece its better than the first in almost every way serving as a perfect wrapup to the story while leaving us hungry for morethis movie is destined to be a major player in the next award season and it deserves every bit of it if you havent seen it yet do yourself a favor and watch it on the biggest screen possible dune part two is a cinematic experience you dont want to miss highly recommended,positive
759,the best move i have ever seen at the theater nothing missing for real the cinematography and direction in this film is something else from another planet from another world literally literally literally three hours of this passed as if it were five minutes creativity creativity unparalleled creativity i cannot wait for the third part i am ready to pay more to see the third part todaythe only thing is i was hoping that the fights would be longer and that the opposite character would be present for a longer period or that they would be on the side of the savior and the savior because they will have a fierce battle,positive
760,after watching dune in the theaters last night i can ensure that this is the ultimate culmination of denis villeneuves vision for dune he can improve upon his previous masterpiece of the first dune movie in tenfold each shot each frame is pure artistry it truly highlights the breadth of the vastness of the desert and mythical culture of dune from the desert sunsets in the sky to the fierce fighting sequences in the sands each scene is a one of amazing magnitude and the visual effects for every sandworm ship and every single aspect is one of master quality each sand worm and ornithopter feels so realistic and tangible like i am watching a reallife documentary than a sci fi film this is especially important given all the cgi complaints over the past year and a half but rest assure the visual effects for dune are all beautifully painstakingly created and are sheer works of craftsmanship,positive
761,dune part two is the best cinematic experience ive ever had i liked the first part for its cinematography sound design and introduction of frank herberts version of a scifi fantasy but the second part exceeds in nearly every aspect everyone liked denis villeneuves dune for establishing a modern scifi fanatsy world but unlike star wars for example it was supposed to introduce to the world of dune from the beginning apart from the sound and setdesign and the sfx the story was rather simple not so dune part two the story picks up speed quickly and packs tons of plot in a short time whilst never sacraficing breathtaking and perfectly timed pictures and scenes the cut is perfect and camera and sfx are even more astonishing than in the first film the topics this film depicts leave extensive food for thought covering politics mass manipulation through religion fate and human behaviour personaly i sometimes thought i was presented with a summary of all star wars the clone wars plots which is a good thing maybe even including the humor the film is funny at times not like marvel but some may be disturbed by it personaly i was not the only negative i noticed after finishing the film is that the score lacks a recognisable theme the arakistheme appears one or two times but the quantity of leitmotifs isnt quite on a star wars level i wouldnt say the film is perfect but rounding up from leads me to my final rating of stars,positive
762,f you are a fan of scifi or if you are a fan of awesomeness you really want to see this movie this movie had something in it for everyone i dont want to spoil it for you because i want you to go to this movie so here are my thoughtsfew sequels are better than the first this one is one of themthis was shot wonderfully you can tell they spent every dollar to make you feel like you were on another world the action was great my main critique with the first one was that it was a little slow i didnt get that from this one the battle within pauls self really comes through on the screen there wasnt one bad performance in this movie this movie should be the new standard that all movies should try to reach make a great movie and people will love it,positive
763,dune directed by denis villeneuve stands as a monumental achievement in modern filmmaking epitomizing the perfect fusion of visionary storytelling breathtaking visuals and captivating performances as the second installment in villeneuves adaptation of frank herberts epic science fiction saga dune surpasses its predecessor in every aspect solidifying its status as a cinematic masterpiece deserving of a perfect ratingone of the most striking elements of dune is its visual prowess from the barren landscapes of arrakis to the intricately designed technology of the futuristic universe every frame is meticulously crafted to immerse the audience in the rich tapestry of herberts universe cinematographer greig fraser masterfully captures the grandeur of the desert planet using sweeping shots and dynamic camera movements to evoke a sense of scale and awe the visual effects seamlessly integrated into the narrative enhance the films otherworldly atmosphere transporting viewers to a universe where the impossible becomes tangiblehowever dune is not merely a feast for the eyes it is also a triumph of storytelling villeneuve and screenwriter jon spaihts skillfully navigate the complex narrative of herberts novel distilling its intricate plot and multifaceted characters into a coherent and engrossing cinematic experience the films pacing is expertly calibrated allowing the story to unfold organically while maintaining a sense of urgency and tension each scene is imbued with meaning contributing to the overarching themes of power destiny and the human conditioncentral to the films success are the performances of its ensemble cast timothe chalamet delivers a tour de force performance as paul atreides the reluctant hero burdened with the weight of prophecy chalamet brings depth and vulnerability to the role embodying pauls internal struggle with grace and nuance opposite him rebecca ferguson shines as lady jessica pauls mother torn between duty and love ferguson infuses her character with strength and complexity elevating her beyond the typical female archetype often found in science fictionthe supporting cast is equally impressive with each actor bringing their agame to the table oscar isaac commands the screen as duke leto atreides projecting authority and compassion in equal measure zendaya captivates as chani the mysterious fremen warrior caught in the midst of a brewing conflict josh brolin and javier bardem round out the ensemble delivering memorable performances that add depth and dimension to the films ensemblebeyond its technical and narrative achievements dune is a triumph of thematic depth and philosophical inquiry at its core the film grapples with timeless questions about power identity and the nature of humanity through pauls journey we are forced to confront the consequences of our actions and the moral complexities of leadership villeneuve deftly explores these themes challenging the audience to reflect on their own beliefs and valuesin addition to its thematic richness dune is a masterclass in worldbuilding villeneuve and his creative team have painstakingly brought herberts universe to life from the intricacies of its political landscape to the nuances of its cultural traditions every detail from the costumes to the set design is thoughtfully crafted to immerse the audience in the world of arrakis and its inhabitants the result is a fully realized and immersive cinematic experience that transports viewers to a distant future unlike anything theyve ever seen beforein conclusion dune is nothing short of a cinematic triumph with its breathtaking visuals compelling storytelling and powerhouse performances it surpasses its predecessor and cements itself as a modern classic denis villeneuve has created a masterpiece that not only honors frank herberts seminal work but also pushes the boundaries of what science fiction cinema can achieve dune is not just a film its an experienceone that deserves to be celebrated and remembered for years to come,positive
764,this movie was epic and the music and visuals where amazing i truly enjoyed almost all the movie seeing dune come to life is a dream come true for many fans unfortunately the character of chani was changed to much from the original omissions and changes for flow make sense but this was purposeful and intended to change an important character maybe the director will go paint in a cell phone on the mona lisa to modernize it next i am afraid that i am now out on his vision and will pay no attention to any future movies from him he was taking care of a modern masterpiece and dropped the ball,positive
765,i am floored with the production value of the whole film every shot looks amazing the sound design and score are flawless the script is a masterclass in writing there is so much exposition that needs to happen that doesnt feel like exposition at all performances effects sets costuming everything is immaculate i was seriously worried i would set my expectations too high seeing early reviews and id be let down but noeven the major changes it makes in adapting the source material only serve to keep the focus of the movie tighter and keeps the pacing of the movie where it needs to be every decision feels thought out and very deliberateif someone can hand deliver a copy of the way of kings to denis villanueve i will venmo you,positive
766,i loved the style and the visuals movie looks spectacularsecond half of the movie i started to get annoyed with chalamet and zendaya as i felt theit screentime was hanpering the story to move forward and i am not a fan of zendayaultimately i felt a quite dissapoontes with the movies finale feeling rushed and superficial it happened in the dirst movie as well as in the secondall in all it feel this movie could have been a lot better then it actually was if the final half focussed less on zendaya and chalamet and more on the actual storypayoff alternatively they should have cut c z screentime in half,positive
767,i thought dune was a masterpiece of film making so no surprise that director d v wasnt even nominated for an oscar or that dune lost the best picture nod to an extremely minor film oscar irrelevancy aside i was looking forward to dune unfortunately the film was a resounding borei even saw the movie twice wondering if i was missing something given the many positive reviews however the same failings i saw on my first viewing were equally evident on second viewinghere they are the look and colours of the film are off either too dark or else blinding it looked washed out and gloomy a monochromatic wash the acting is good but many of the lines are whispered so its hard to hear or understand scene after scene of extreme closeups and dialogue ad nauseum the film is a boring talkfest most egregious the film plays out like a series of scenes strung together theres little that drives this film it is all one note sad to say i dozed off during both showings,positive
768,i was blown away by the sheer power and efficiency of the storyline in this film unlike its predecessor which occasionally felt dragged out every scene in this sequel felt vital and impactful the dialogue crackled with intensity leaving me inspired and movedmanaging character development in a film with a large ensemble cast can be a daunting task but here it was executed flawlessly each main and supporting character brought something unique to the table enriching the narrative and adding depth to the storyfrom the seamless editing to the captivating score the stunning cinematography to the exceptional acting every aspect of this film was executed to perfection watching it in imax only heightened the experience elevating it to a whole new level of cinematic brilliancein short this film is a masterpiece in every sense of the word i wholeheartedly recommend experiencing it on the biggest screen possible to fully appreciate its grandeur and impact,positive
769,this movie was a completely immersive experience dune is a real achievement in cinema nowdaysthe characters the story the soundtrack and even the peace felt so well done that is hard to believe that this movie is almost hours longthe wait for this sequel was totally worth it villanueve knows the exact way to take audiences breath and capture their attention hes aware of the peace problem from the last part that now has perfectioned something that it was already perfect making the film felt more exciting and compellingthis movie is everything that was the first one and more this kind of movie is reason why theaters exist and dune part made me remeber it,positive

771,an entertaining movie in a current industry that has little entertainment coming out of it movies are meant to be entertaining not preach or shove agendas down our throats or think of us as stupid watch the film youll enjoy it the story differs slightly from the novel as its impossible to put a book direct to movie denis was true to heart and true to the source material the actors did very well the story was tight and even my mother who has no idea about the source material was able to understand what was going on and really loved the son daughter relationship between paul and jessica please make dune messiah,positive
772,damn what a movie not gonna spoil or say to much about it this is a movie you just have to whiteness it for yourself in a cinema preferably with dolby atmos because damn the sound and ofcourse the music by hans zimmer is so on point with the stuff you see on screenthe openings scenes is one of the best i have seen in a movie in a while the cinematography used in that sequence was superb sucked you immediately in the movie great job by denis villeneuvenot sure if it is better then part but definitely on the same level gave them both a for the ones wondering it has more action then the first gladly it wasnt over the top blockbuster actioni remember looking at the time not because of for how long is this still going but because of how long do we still have left i dont want this to end,positive
773,words cannot describe how good this movie really is starting off this film is not just your typical action film this film has a story it keeps you thinking on what will happen next it is very suspenseful and action packed the vilians in this film do a great job they show them in such a dark way that gives them justice that they are a strong villian paul as the character was amazing i cannot put it into words on how a good role model and a great leader is overall this film is a must watch and it is only to be seen on imax because it was designed for it with the aspect ratio and this film deserves an oscar for sure,positive
774,first of all let me tell you that i walked out of the cinema thinking that i had just watched a documentary straight out of another time and place absolutely nothing looked out of place every detail was perfectly integrated into the scene the cinema was packed something i hadnt seen in a long time the audience was transfixed and transported to a world beyond our wildest imaginations simple and beautiful on the outside complex and dark on the inside with a glimmer of hope for a better future to come frank herberts work will help generations of people to open their minds and see thank you dune crew,positive
775,visually beautiful but unhappy with the changes from the source material the performances were great especially chalamet as paul and zendaya as chani butler was also stunning as feyd and one of the best fight scenes ive seen in a while one major character completely left out with some very random mentions a few other key characters left out are a bit more understandable with the time restraints not as much world building on the fremen as i wouldve liked some characters felt completely different than the novel the third act was rushed you spend less time with irulan and the emperor in the books but somehow their presence felt skippable in the film he was so close,positive
776,its probably been said before by someone else that this adaptation is one frank hurbert would have been happy to have watchedsince i agree with most of the themes of the books including the relevance of ecology to the current global narrative i played my small role in promoting this movie by buying admissiondenis villeneuve and his team continue to push the boundaries of scifi cinema i was especially impressed with the mobiusish neonoir stylistic elements which pays homage to the history of scifi and the visual novelty of large antigravity machinery and the sardaukar hope we get a great conclusion to the cinematic trilogy,positive
777,i dont share the concerns of those complaining about the intricacies of the plot i havent read the book but watched david lynchs version back in the s and understood this just fine mind you i have read jodorowskys duneinfluenced incal so this was nothing to that level of bizarre and fantastical my concern was the ridiculous length it seemed like the countless netflix movies where they think that playing two piano chords in a long drawn out way and showing characters blankly pondering emotions makes it a scandinavian masterpiecedune part two just took too long to do very little considering the book is considered unfilmable i expected there to be too many concepts and plot lines crammed in but instead watched three hours of drawn out ponderous scenes attempting to be a hallucinogenic trip but not having the conviction to commit to itit was undeniably magnificently shot scored and choreographed the sound design was incredible i enjoyed looking and listening to it especially the unique action scenes but dialogue was often very trite and too on the nose the vehicles were still good but lacked the visual impact of part one and characters were given disappointingly anticlimactic payoffsthis was a top end as well very graphic and uncomfortable in many places beware taking sensitive kids to see thisi enjoyed part one i gave that stars but was more wowed by the spectacle than the acting or plot i love denis villenuves work but lynch was a closer match to the source material this instalment lacked the impetus of the first and therefore flapped pretentiously about as a placeholder between part one and three it lacks the wonderful weirdness of frank herberts worldespecially in the very poorly cast emperor love the actor but out place here jodorowsky had cast salvador dal and somehow that tells you all you need to knowim not afraid of a long film or an arthouse film i love science fiction from the forbidden planet and star wars to and arrival this perhaps simply suffers from the praise heaped on the original and ended up working too hard to be even more spectacular,positive
778,sorry but no this is a farce and a scam where as in dune part there was a story a plotline visible logic and a clear path in this part there is absolutely not it has been massively cut and shortened or if this is the script its lazier than a old fat catroles are comicaly unphased no connection of rabaul or the archvillain from the actor to its role there is nothing that connects the two partsyes the image and coloring effects and such are superb but the rest is a waste of my time a waste of everybodies time a waste of ressources and a waste of talentlazyness pure lazyness,negative
779,when ones destiny is to rule their people one wont quit until it has been achievedthats what paul atreides played by timothee chalamet must decide in this two part epic that is still unfolding with another part of the soon to be trilogy on its waypicking up immediately from the film the suspense heightens quickly and does not hold anything back with the camera mainly focusing on far and wide shots in the dense and humid environment of the dunes rushes of adrenaline will hit you hard as you watch the sequences unfold in the opening scenes the director denis villeneuve stepped up his game from the first film to truly capture the movement and living qualities of the characters in the desertthe film doesnt waste your time by reintroducing everything but rather expects you to know what happened previously as this is basically their version of the empire strikes back within the soon to be trilogy the main subject that stood out to me throughout the film was character growth most characters go through change or experience changes around them some more than others further enhancing their capabilities and raising the bar for how far they reached to achieve their goals the character that i thought experienced the most changes was paul atreidespaul atriedes slowly made his way up the ladder from doubting himself for following in his fathers footsteps to coming to his own terms and realizing the true potential he has by breaking away from his original idea of being his fathers predecessor paul now realizes that he can do so much more pauls growth from the first film to this one was immense and important once a selfjudging and insecure person to someone who has everyone looking up to him not just as a leader but a savior is noteworthy in and of itself with every good leader or religious figure there is always one downside or trait that follows them and for paul its his desperate hunger for power the further he goes on the path hes following for everything good hes committing to he slowly loses himself in a power hungry struggleflorence pughs performance in the film although quite small is all encompassing as it should be since she is the daughter of the emperor after all pugh gives off a strong sense of empowerment that i think the emperor played by christopher walken didnt quite have on screen having a high status on her shoulders she also carried the slightest hint of worry never knowing what could happen between her father and her people she also brings a lot of emotional weight when it comes to her facial expressions as shes able to say so much without speaking from the shock she gives off to the short but sweet smiles it all makes for a more dramatic but beautiful look for the filmaustin butlers performance in the film is quite a suspenseful one not only is he another new addition to the already large list of characters he brings a vibe like no other when we first meet his character the color grading changes from vibrant and bright to a black and white scheme giving off a sinister look to his character and many others i previously mentioned facial expressions and how florence pugh did an excellent job yet it is austin butler however who takes it above and beyond everyones expectations the way he brought some of his sinister expressions had the same effect as azog did from the hobbit trilogy of films especially when he was a fully cg rendered character i personally think he outperformed dave bautista and stellan skarsgard who were in the same boat as him playing another role as members of the familytimothee chalamets performance in this film is a far step ahead from where he was originally in the first film truly showing what hes capable of as an actor and this is most evident towards the later acts of the film chalamet brings a lot of charm to the role as paul allowing the audience to connect with him as he taps into a leadership role which the audience may be able to relate to if they have had to be a leader in their lives chalamet takes the emotional status that paul has from the first film to a whole new level in this second film having previously had more of a laid back focus to his character even though hes the heart of both films he pushed the limits this time as he breaks that barrier and becomes the leader he was meant to beat the end of the day dune part two is a phenomenal piece of cinema that we dont get all that often to see this film on the big screen even if its not on imax is still a beauty of a film to look at thanks to greig fraser the cinematographer would i recommend this film to the general audience no as it is a slow burner mainly focusing on heavy character development but when it comes to pure film lovers this shouldnt be overlooked,positive
780,everything youve read about dune part is true certainly one of the most immersive theatrical experiences its visually rich technically brilliant wellwritten passionately wellmade and will obviously go down in history as one of the best scififantasy epics with great performances and awesome worldbuilding its a visual feast for scifi enthusiasts like me i dont know how closely it adapts the novel but how can anyone call paul a hero for his jihad being responsible for deaths of billions across the universe and eradication of different religions including fremens just to get his revenge while he was wellintentioned in the beginning his transformation post drinking worm poison was surprising but thats what power and religious fanaticism does to people apparently thats what jihadis have done throughout history since the inception of the desert cult pretty smart that dune replaces realworld mental illness delusions of grandeur and hallucinations of a certain prophet with worm poison hahah poor stilgar i want to see what chani does next and more details and history of the sisterhood bene gesserit what exactly is the plan of pauls mother as well as the mysterious role of pauls sister nothing can convince me women in burkhas or nikaabs can have that much power lol,positive
781,the movie is an absolute perfectionthe story is super interesting director did an amazing job with this movie the cgi is as real as it can get the sound and music production is top notchthe cast did amazing job with the acting the way the protagonist changes his approach and attitude just gave me goosebumps the cgi was top notch saw it in imax and it was totally worth itthere is only some places where i felt that the story telling was a bit missed how the protagonist raised to power and everyones involvement in it was a little bit hazy it felt like it all happened very fast and chances are you wont even notice itbut anyway totally worth it and recommend,positive
782,this complex story was simplified an achievement in itself eliminated the right things and enhanced the right things i can tell this work of art came from a true fan of the bookssome scenes i felt were better done than the book itself especially how he proves it to the council that he is the true messiah i enjoyed the books and this movie just makes the books better for methe changes with the story of paul and chani leaves a bit if unpredictability for the people who have already read the book the way he chooses to take the water of life is also fresh for the fans of the bookdennis might truly be able to take on the challenge of creating the god emperor books as well,positive
783,there were only three things i didnt like christopher walken was horribly miscast it was like he was dropped in from another movie all i could see was christopher walken not the character he was portraying the second miscast was florence pugh it just seems like shes in everything right now which is probably why i have pugh fatigue with her performance she also seemed a little outside of the dune universe lastly glossu harkonnen got a wicked nerf bat in part which was a tad strange in the first he was perceived as brutal and fearless and in part he was a coward and a screwup besides those three critiques the movie itself was fantastic,negative
784,i never right reviews often but i just have to let this one out this film is nothing but a masterpiece just like the first one im so impressed with everything from music acting cinematography world character building is quite unique i cant say these sort of films come around often but without the first film this would be very confusing to understand i thought there would be more action or maybe the action scenes to have lasted a little bit longer but we cant win them all without question dune part are my favourite movies of all time i will watch them religiously till the day i die and part,positive
785,the movie was good the scenery was good and i love that they kept to their native fremen language chakobsa the weaponry and fighting was nice but where was the wierding modules the key to their victory the weapons that will shatter their bones bleed them out from withinthe harkonnen where made to look cool i must say the view from their homeworld and their weird look on human flesh visually stunning in black and white i am missing good battles thou the fight between rabban and gurney was bad rather have him shanked to death by a hundred fremen for all the suffering he has donethe sardukar was a lack luster also rather have a big battle between the sardukar then letting them die of screen in a puff of sand smokethe emperors barge was a last luster also the colors inside the ship where he resides its all empty no gold no nothing actually its just a dark background its almost like it was pushed out as fast as possible the same what happened to alia she was never born sure you can change it out thats okay but she is a key player same with the fight between the reverend mother and alia but they could at least have changed it for a fight between reverend mother and lady jessica because as we know one word can kill and your soul will be lost forever,positive
786,this is a simple and short review go see this movie in the theatre if possible and on a very big screen we both loved itwe spent the last week in khao lak heaven but the week before we watched dune part and then saw part in the theatre on the day it opened it was grand and epic storytelling on a scale ive not seen in ages both dune movies are transportive like titanic in and the original avatar in which i saw four times including once at the chinese theatre ive not read any of the dune books but i was able to grok what was going on mainly and while i havent always been a timothe chalamet fan he was excellent here as was zendaya rebecca ferguson javier bardem and many others everything about the movie is epic and its well worth a cinema visit,positive
787,denis villeneuves dune is an ambitious continuation of the epic saga delivering stunning visuals and a gripping narrative that captivates audiences while the film is undeniably a cinematic triumph its not without its shortcomingsnotably the adaptation overlooks critical aspects such as the weirding way and pranabindukey elements of herberts universe that enrich the lore and depth of the story lynchs way maybe was a bad representation with the sounds guns and stuff keep in mind the age and lack of tech like todaymoreover the marginalization of alia atreides role diminishes the characters significance and her intricate relationship with the overarching plot these omissions while not detracting from the overall enjoyment of the movie leave a palpable void for fans familiar with the source material,positive
788,what in the actual hll what is with the star reviews this is far from a perfect movie all they had to do was stay true to a story that has already been masterfully written and they would have had a great movie instead we got this dribble terrible why not make this movie and call it something else instead of trying to make it sound like it was based on the book sand pirates dumb buy two tickets for a hour movie visual spectacle bad story anything else but dune i was so looking forward to seeing the second half of the book revealed and i was left in the dust disgusted by this movie,positive
789,this is cinema at its finestjust watched dune part two in an imax theater and it was inarguably the best cinematic spiritual experience ive ever had as a fan of the novels i am in awe of how the characters from the second half of dune comes to life with the stellar castdeniss storytelling was on point the religious aspect and the fremen culture in particular resonated with me the most since part one from the incredible sound design zimmers score ancientfuturistic production design frasers cinematography and his clever use of bw imagery to the entertaining screenplay flawless editing and the stunning visual effects this motion picture might just be the culmination of villeneuves career he has leveled up his game with dune part two working on this scale requires mastery in filmmaking which he has achieved flawlessly enjoyed every single frame of this movie cleverly embraced the looser adaptations of the book and aligned it to the plotdune part two is constantly challenged by conflicting political decisions sociology cultural influences and religion yet the heart of it is a love story that carries the flow and weight of alli stood up from my seat awestruck overwhelmed after the immersive consumption of a classic toptier space opera masterpiece and got the chills down my spine during the ending creditsim thrilled to see how this trilogy ends when dune messiah makes a comeback most recommended to watch it in the biggest screen you can get preferably imax for now ill have to rewatch and be anticipating for its oscar sweep next year,positive
790,the story the characters the visuals the twist the mashup of sound and feelings was just mind bending it gave me goosebumps actually ill be watching this movie for countless times and im sure i will come to love it more and more and more scifi seems to be on the rise again and dune part shows the start of an amazing coming yearin all honesty i think for dune to be beaten it will take a lot of even such is possiblei am extremely happy i was able to live this experience to enjoy such an amazing movie on the big screen and id say its a as it should be a just a wonderful experience thank you dennis alljust saw it again and its even better,positive
791,this movie does so many things right i dont even know where to start atmosphere costumes acting lighting music tension build up and the list goes on if you like the genre even a little bit its an absolute must seethe story is interesting and original its a combination of intrige philosophy culture scifi and religion in a futuristic feudal setting and surprises you from time to time i have not read the books so i dont know if the film follows the original story closely but it worked perfect for me anywayi loved every second of the movie but was completely blown away by the last hour,positive
792,very few movies live up to their prerelease hype dune does that and then some this movie managed to exceed my expectations i will be thinking about this movie for days and will watch it again several more times the last time a movie blew my mind like this was when the first avatar came out in theaters or the dark knight or braveheart this movie ranks at the top of the list of the best movies of all time the sound track by hans zimmerman is also amazing it really moves your heart and emotions while watching the film ive ordered the book now and cant wait to read it go see this movie in theaters before its digital release youll be glad you did,positive
793,dune is my favorite novel of all time i love it so much that david lynchs version is enjoyable because of its incomprehensibilityi might be biased when i say denis villeneuve is probably the best modern director but ive thought that long before even dune part sicario was my first foray into his territory and it was astoundingly brilliant arrival and blade runner both stuck with me for months dune pt set my expectations highpt sticks that landing and then some i wanted to see it again the day after i saw it its epic beautiful well paced and surprisingly funny its not that marvel humor its little jabs here and there that are a chuckle to add levityaustin butlers feydrautha is the standout character being just unpredictably gruesome and loathsome and his pitch perfect imitation of stellan skarsgaards voice for the baron,positive
794,i was absolutely blown away by this film its a cinematic masterpiece for its time it cannot be compared to the st one which was genius in its own way what i did right this time is that i watched it in the imax theatre wowit has to be seen on the extra big screen with phenomenal sound if not then also ok but its the only way you can truly submersive yourself in the finer details of this film the sound the acting the soundtrack the landscape the score the storyit is a work of art denis villeneuve the true genius that he is created a masterpiece in every aspect what a privilege to watch,positive
795,watched the movie on tv via amazon with great expectation and though the cgi was exceptional arent they all i was left with feeling less than completely satisfied when will filmmakers understand that the lowerquality tv transmissions of movies fail to show any detail in nighttime scenes all characters spoke american with the exception of a zorbatype who was somehow greek there were occasional efforts to acknowledge the original book though such was evidently not the in directors remit but for the most part the plot was incomprehensible unlike the version which is much superior in most respects as might have been expected the unsatisfactory ending i was left with a feeling of being left not so much in midair as low orbit closed with the opportunity of a further sequel but as with most sequels they are but pale shadows of earlier versions in this case the movie or best of all read the book tiramisu all froth and little substance,positive
796,i watched all hours and minutes of this film in a state of rapture our theater was silent no one moved no one spoke no one got up to use the restroom it was as if we were all transported to arrakis together and we had no choice but to experience every moment of itand it was glorious to say this film is magnificent is an understatement to say its phenomenal does not fully explain its effectevery shot is tuned precisely to what we need to see every sound and musical cue is perfectly matched with its visual component the acting is flawless across the board the cinematography is absolutely brilliantalmost three hours of movie and i wanted more we all wanted morein my opinion there are only three genredefining fantasy stories star wars the lord of the rings and dune after seeing dune part one and this magnificent sequel if i had to pick just one universe i would choose the universe of arrakis of caladan of paul and chani of feyd and baron of princess irulan every timelong live the fighters,positive
797,as a big fan of dune the movie is so overrated by most critics in my opinion its definitely the best creation ever made for dune but its not a masterpiece and the epic moments in it are so short that actually made me angrybeside the many changes compared to the origin story some good some bad that i could live with the movie focuses too much on the relationship between paul and chani while missing many other major issues that some of them didnt even get screen time chanis part is just way too big the fact that the movie ends up with her face symbolizes thatbut the thing that was the most disappointing for me is the action scenes in the big assault of the fremen at the end that were very epic with maybe minutes long i think villeneuve messed this up big timethe shadukar the strongest force of the emperor in the universe i want to see more how its defeated the defeat of all the harkonnen forces also almost nothing of it was shown we didnt even get to see paul storms with the fremen and fight in this battle at the point when they reach to the emperor and his people there was a line of shadukar troops walking into the fog and disappearing before paul arrives why not make a small action scene there i really dont get it i didnt expect this movie to contain long big scale action sequences just like lord of the rings movies but it seems to me that the director was literally trying to avoid them no matter whative seen the movie twice since i like dune so much it has one of the best casts ever made rebecca ferguson performance is remarkable the story is more than amazing the visuals dressings are stunning the sound off course is mind blowing all were so excellentthis really should have been the best science fiction movie since decades i dont believe a perfect movie can be created but this one could have been the closest thing to a perfect movie and it missed the opportunity to be that,positive
798,three hours of boredom yes thats rightthree hours of clockwatching boredom wondering if you need to take a whizzdune part two is essentially driven by hype and denis villeneuve fans who truly havent grasped that his work though spectacular on the cinematography front is limited in terms of dialogue and character building shielded by an aesthetic that gives the impression that such projects are impressivedune part two is laden with lazy cgi wooden acting and poor casting choices that drive this movie further into the ground the screenplay and pacing are banal and certain scenes are poorly plannedthere is little to be excited by and you dont need to have read the book to have a take on this given that is the point of adaptations,negative
799,this film will go down in history as one of the best sci fi films of all time every thread and aspect of this film is finely woven and well inspected and it works like a roaring beastly powerful machine the music and visuals work in such stunning synchronicity hans zimmer was really the only man for the job dont go into the film having already listened to the music to help the breathtaking experience villeneuve has given himself an impossible job making dune messiah stand up to this film im sure its possible villeneuve has proved time and time again to be one of the most powerful filmmakers of his generation,positive
800,being as someone who has never read the books i found both movies very interesting and intriguing the concept of another story about a tragic hero may seem boring and overused to some but this story at least this movie saga does it right the first movie is perfect in setting up the events that take place in the second one the filmography is spectacular the sound design might be the best this year and the acting is phenomenal too the movie is hours long but from the very start of the movie you are on the edge of your seat the scene in the coliseumlike venue might be my favorite sequence this year and spoiler the end fight between paul and the harkonen fighter is great i went into this movie with good expectations and left feeling more than satisfied and wanting more at the same time all i hope is that there will at least be a dune after this,positive
801,one of the greatest films of this decade so far in many aspects of cinema this film exceedsthe cinematography acting music production design editing directing and more are all worthy of an academy award nomination if not a winseeing this in true aspect ratio imax laser at boeing pacific science center in seattle was one the most breathtaking cinema experiences i have ever hadthe cast is stellar and greg frasiers cinematography is again magnificent timothee chalamet and zendaya did a very good job as paul and chani as did the other cast it gets better when paul really kicks it in in the rd act rebecca ferguson did a very good job as jessica and stands outthe comedic relief from javier bardems stilgar is enjoyable i know there are mixed feelings about christopher walkens emperor but he did a fine job but didnt do anything special he was just therewhere this movie suffers is the dreadful pace the first two thirds of the movie drag on despite stuffing what was two years in the book to a couple months in the movie this does lead to the ending feeling rusheddune part two is an amazing cinematic achievement and definitely one of the best films of the but i would not at all deem it as one of the greatest sequels of all time or compare it to the dark knight or the empire strikes back coincidently this is the same as the imdb rating,positive
802,cinematography is next level the desert the colors in every scene capture the mood so well world building is good and we are introduced with new concepts bit by bit especially liked the intensity by ruthathe action scenes are well scripted the protagonist looks vulnerable and is not like a usual action herosavior of the world chemistry is great between female and male lead some funny moments as well javier bardem looks great in appearance and actingeven though the movie is long one is looking forward to whats about to happen next in the same league as part looking forward to next one,positive
803,well part definitely delivers on the promise of part try to see them close together this is really one film cut into partsthere are some quite major deviations from the original frank herbert i am at a loss to explain why the writers have done this as they didnt need tothe impact of dune is as tremendous as the novels acting is excellent camera work excellent music superb the mesmerising quality of the desert planet arrakis is brilliantly done this thing is breathtaking its scale is vastdont listen to anyone who says the dune films are no good they are fantastic,positive
804,after waiting a few days to digest as a fan of frank herberts novels and dennis villenueves adaptation of part one i cannot be happier while staying faithful to the core of the book dennis makes his own path and increases the intensity and complexity of how powerful this story is the gripping thrill it brings to the table minute by minute as we see the second half of herberts vision come to life was something i could not have imagined all the actors are their characters the star studded cast only builds on top of each other and elevate one another at the same time in unison the directing editing cinematography and overall production of this movie is the reason people go to the movies as a sincere lover of part one still it does not even compare to the upgrade part two is go to the movies near you take your family and enjoy this cinematic event worth remembering,positive
805,yes dune part two looks fantastic better than the first movie i dare say but it felt to me that i was watching a highly expurgated version of the film even at close to hours it seemed very much incomplete and condensed to the detriment of the storyscenes and thus major parts of the plot jumped around haphazardly i dont mind not having every little thing spelled out for me in a movie but there were nearly a dozen times where i thought wait did i miss something what happened between the previous scene and this onei honestly have to wonder if the original was a far longer cut of the film and the studio made the director cut it way down for distribution because it could easily use an additional hour at minimum to fill in gapsas a result i didnt care about any of the characters at all so nothing resonated with me emotionally oh they tried their best with plenty of bombastic music cues and grandiose shots of troops and ships and worms but in the end it all amounted to far less than the sum of its partsso with all that said you may think is a generous rating for me to give but i appreciate there was at least some effort given to this film art design effects cinematography sound design were all topnotch too bad the rest of it fell so short for me,positive
806,dune reviewthe following was my first reaction after watching this filmit was good but it was long i mean it was good it was good but it was long now im not saying i didnt like it it was good ok but it was long did it need to be that long well ok it was a really big story so yeah ok it probably needed to be that long but it was long man but it was good but it was long i dont know what my final decision is because you know it was good but it was longi caught someone sitting in front of me checking the time as the film slowly slogged on performances were solid all around the story is well worn the photography was well iconic but it seemed a little too much on the extreme close ups of faces my god the lensing was so tight that in one shot the characters eyes were in focus but his nose was out of focus on imax we can inspect every pore on his skinoverall there was something more exciting about part one as we are introduced to the setup am intriguing world shot in a iconic way engaging characters in energetic scenes i saw the first part twice in the theatre i have the dvd at home and have watched it again since i am not so excited about revisiting part two i guess its a kind of phenomena like the matrix the first film was very appealing because of its well crafted fantasy world that was exciting to learn about but by the second movie it was already kind of been there done that i sort of had the same reaction with the dark knight rises after enjoying the bombastic dark knightdune as a story is so popular george lucas used it as one of his sources for star wars the chosen one template is very familiar and it takes largerthanlife filmmaking to make it something that stands out this comes in the form of the depiction of a desert world that has gargantuan flying machines the domiciles in this world are simple but elegant the costumes are evocative of ancient religions the music fit as well as it did in part oneappropriately the second movie is simply titled part two for it is more of the same so the second outing there is less awe to some degree and more drama with shots of very very large heads im not knocking this film in any way i think perhaps my own short attention span is at fault as an editor i wouldnt dare question the wisdom of the people who put this together it is a service to all fans of this classic story to tell it right perhaps if i was the director i would pick up the pacing of the dialogue just a wee little bit but im sure it wouldnt work as wellin conclusion the movie has many good scenes of grandeur but has more scenes of big faces sure great care was taken to hire some of the most attractive faces available so that helps i guess i enjoy rollicking adventures more than slightly sedate adventures like this one maybe time will change my attitude about part two compared to part one but for now i will give it a out of,positive
807,this is the kind of film no experience that comes along once in awhilevilleneuve and co bring every incredible aspect of filmmaking to bear in this heartpounding gasp for breath sensory assault that truly takes the viewer out of their seat and immerses them in the storyit felt as if one were witnessing not just a story unfolding on screen with masterful sound and perhaps infrasound epic cinematography sublime sequences superlative production fastidious costume design terrific acting from the entire cast this viewer felt as if i were witnessing something real such was the intensity of the roller coaster type experiencei was initially concerned at the run time but hours was enough for viileneuve to translate one of the most difficult novels to screenadditionally and as a keen historian philosophy and mythology enthusiast i recognised many motifs drawn from the oldest myths themes that could easily have felt tired trite and banal were displayed refreshingly and with an authenticity that made me smile with satisfactionsuch subtle nods and references to old themes so well done it was a celebration of thousands of years of storytelling allegory metaphor and myththis unlike so many tainted films and series of our time avoided tokenism political messaging virtue signaling and all the other shallow cultural cliches which was refreshing in and of itselfthe masterful displays by the matriarchal priestesses lead by the inimitable charlotte rampling pays homage to the ancient pre abrahamic pre egyptian cultures of the late bronze age where priestesses were matriarchs and exercised great power and influencethe references to the djinn was also one that delighted this viewerin fact this story is closer to our own history and mythology with a few exceptions blurring the line between sci fi and historyfinally all i can say is that this piece must be experienced on the big screen with dynamic sound to be fully appreciatedit certainly deserves all the accolades and praise as it is truly an instant classic and im sure will become a cult classic whose influence will persevere for some time to come,positive
808,there was some drawn out parts for but there was some really cool visuals the arena scene with feyd was really cool i dont understand how such powerful bad guys have such quick and cheesy deaths though beast rabba died without much of a fight baron literally layed there for like minutes and didnt move he lost all his powers with those floating bags come on weak then feyd just watched as his family is taken out the emporer just sits back while paul waltzes in and takes out the barron come on the writing was a little lazy i hope they step it up for the rd installment a new group of bad guys for the hero to fight,negative
809,the scenery the costumes the performances of some the actors are excellent however past the few elements that makes watching the movie not a complete waste of time but not something youre really satisfied with glaring weaknesses remainits too often overdramatic it makes copious use of the same boring and easy techniques to create superficial drama the zoomin on characters taking an embarrassing heroic pose or looking deeply intense with determined eyes and a slight frownoh and the shouting characters and crowd shouting ad nauseam the same mantras as if to make us simpletons understand basic concepts by repeating them three four five times we got it move on done and seen a thousand times elsewhereon that subject this movie is very loud in every sense of the word sometimes the actors shout for no apparent reason other than to convey to the public that theyre saying something important thing is it actually has the opposite effect its like a child throwing a tantrum demanding to be heard then theres the action scenes oh my did they overdo them its constant blasting and fighting the fast food of the movie industry the louder the better explosions fast camera movements noise all around as if the void of the script needed to be filled at all time with visual stunts so that you dont have to think too hard about the storyit follows that the dialogues are weak really weak if one isolated the words and read them theyd be appalled by the sheer stupidity and shallowness of some of the lines and obviously it would look completely ridiculous compared to the bookall in all this is just a mass market product that has some moments but that is plagued by the necessity to appeal to everyone and places the bar for that everyone very low it does not expect much from itself or from its audience and so you leave the theater wondering what was the point,positive
810,one of the best movies ive ever seen honestly in acting pacing cinematography soundtrack visual effects and storyline this will go down as one of the greatest films of all time especially in scifi this is peak filmmaking with such a long runtime i was pleasantly surprised that each scene was direct and meaningful to the plot no fluff at all and just helping build up the action emotions and world its always great when directors trust the audiences intelligencetimothee chalamets acting was so powerful for such a young and skinny boy i was on the edge of my seat especially in his religious leader moments the cast was nothing short of incredible,positive
811,i have never read any of the books so i am not at all invested in the source material thus i interpreted the characters and the story freely only to later find out that paul will eventually become a menace upon the world but so be it still he is some sort of a hero for me in this movie even more so after his transformationhe does have a darknessseriousnesscoldness about him but it just seemed to me like a groundedrealistic view of the world and the things to come he can see the futures so he knows what needs to be done to thread the needle and outsmart the houses and emperor and free the fremen i need to go to the cinema again and watch it again it really transports you to another place and immerses you in the universe that it creates awesome movie,positive
812,after falling in love right away with the first dune reading the book waiting two years and then waiting five months due to the writers strike i finally saw dune part two and let me tell you if this isnt at least in my top favorite movies of the year i will be amazed this is far more than just a worthy sequel it absolutely surpasses the already spectacular first part its a lot more fast paced with a ton more action and since we got most of the heavy exposition out of the way in part one the film now mostly focuses on letting the visuals tell the story and what a story it is not only is it an awesome scifi epic not only is it a cool revenge tale but its the saga of our main characters rise to power coupled with his fall from grace pauls journey from refusing to become the lisan al gaib to embracing the moniker and using it to suit his needs is as captivating as it is intensethe cast does an even better job than the first film timothy chalamet who was a little bland in part one slowly grows into a terrifying presence who perfectly sells pauls descent into madness he has solid chemistry with chani and zendaya does a great job displaying her love for him and sadness at what he becomes javier bardem goes a little over the top in his belief in paul but i never doubt his passion and faith the new characters are fantastic christopher walken is fun as always as the emperor and austin butler is terrifying as feydrautha but the real star is rebecca ferguson her development is just as captivating as pauls and she is downright scary at timesvisually the film blows me away the taste we got of arrakis in part one is fully realized here the fremen culture is fully explored shown through paul and jessicas eyes as outsiders and presented through stellar sets the sound music directing and cinematography are all fantastic the color scheme runs the full gambit from the red and brown of arrakis to the black white and grey of the villains world this is also the first film i saw in imax where the sound actually lived up to its reputationoverall dune part two was more than worth the wait i loved every second of it and you can bet i have every intention of buying it when it comes out on bluray as for dune messiah whenever denis villeneuve makes it ill be right there in the theater to enjoy,positive
813,this is one of those movies that will set the standard high as to what a blockbuster movie should be professional acting that draws out emotions in you to feel the struggle that chani paul the emperor lady jessica the harkonens all have to take in the most epic of struggles for power and survival incredible fight scenes through out the movie you will be set into many aspects of battle both from a far to where you see what brutal outcomes and disastrous consequences of battle to the outcomes of war up close and personal struggles of blade to blade your life or my life battles beautiful graphics amazing scenery this movie amazed and delivered really did not want the movie to end and you will be left yearning to know just as much as the emperor chani and paul the witch guild will end because of what they have set in play for this incredible epic saga i want to see more,positive
814,ohh boy how i missed movies like this in these daysfinally movies that worth watching and waiting fori thought the st one was so good but dune what an absolotely masterpiecethe acting from every actor actress was phenominal could feel thet tension and feeling from each of themthe skarsgrd family are awesome top level actingthe cgi was beautiful it looked so good the worms are frightning and the whole sandy area colors makes you feel like youre inside the movie especially if watching it in imaxi really hope the rd movie will be top level like this first two i know its hard but i put my trustps im not a fan of the games nor the books never played the game or watched the old moviesbut now i do d,positive
815,just when i thought that denis could not outdo his bladerunner dont get me wrong first part of dune was beautifully executed however part shines like a beacon of hope for the art of cinema editting is superb to the tee visually the film is to be studied for many ears ahead but in order to keep it up to the hour mark there wer cutoffs from script and timeline i would have easily accepted this divided in two parts just so the gaps of inbetween especially for those who have read the books were spared nevertheless the job was masterfully done a well deserved bow to mr vileneuve the cinematographers editors cast and the music and sound crew,positive
816,starstudded technically impecabble cinematographically amazing and continuously bombasticlike its predecessor dune part two is a genuine cinematic experience executed with a lot of palpable effort and technical greatnessvilleneuve has achieved an epic blockbuster entertaining and artistic as it can befilled with a rich variety of characters new and old and with a multitude of storylinest the movie aims to translate the depth and wideness of frank herberts novel altough i do not care about it like some faithful followers of the literary work one has to acknowledge that the films translation could never have matched it this is simply due to technical capabilitiesnonetheless the movie is overall very impressive with a captivating party it is not perfect as shown in my point of view with the pacing problems in fact while the last part is utterly epic its rapidity shows structural flaws in the narative levelthe film ends again with a teaser for the third film the final installment of the dune trilogy announces itself as topping everything the two previous movies have achieved it will be epic,positive
817,i watched the movie in cinema and while it was in no way a bad movie i ended up disappointed because according to the current rating of i can definitely say it is overrated i have enjoy the first part morethe problem i have with the movie is that despite its length it seems to be cramming too many events into the movie and you have a feeling you are constantly skipping ahead from one point to the next without the proper buildup to achieve the significance of some key events which on the other hand is interesting considering the length of the movie there is also a lot of talking in this movie and not much action basically action scenes are over quickly and there isnt much buildup to the last battle which again is over so ridiculously quickly and all the duels also are over so quick so i just couldnt immerse myself or feel the significance of things happening on screen because it was like a speed run of many events which i hate napoleon movie for example had this exact same issue for memain character also has many looking cool walking doing nothing important scenes that i am not a fan ofoverall it is in no way a bad movie it is a good movie but it is in no way a masterpiece in my opinion,positive
818,dennis did his job well cinematographer greig fraser went next level the second part is much more better than the part i and yeah the music is so sensational and chilling the main theme brings goosebumps hans zimmer the legend this movie is meant to be seen in cinema houses imax would be much more interesting the first half of the movie is slow paced not slowslow but political and then after the intermission is where it gets bombed paul aka timothee really played his character well i never imagined this guy could handle action sequences overall the movie is must watch cant wait for rd part,positive
819,it was an okay movie but i dont think that it needed to be hours a lot of useless scenes in my opinion and zendaya looking angry at the camera for and a half hour in other words the excessive runtime left me questioning the necessity of a threehour saga numerous scenes felt gratuitous and added little to the overall plot contributing to a sense of dragging monotony zendayas prolonged stern expressions seemingly directed at the camera became a repetitive distraction rather than a compelling element overall the film lacked efficient storytelling making it an okay experience at best,negative
820,you can only omit so much you lose a lot of the meaning in the book i wonder if they even read the book the david lynch version is far better than this one the acting was decent the special effects especially the sandworm was poor if you read the book you will be disappointed if you havent read the book please do it us not this junk puals sister isnt even born at the start of the war i think the director has misinterpreted the entire story they plan on doing children of dune i wish they would not do it after this poor attempt you have a novel that has been renowned for years and then you twist it by leaving out major parts of the story no weirding devices a lot goes on in dune simple things have a profound difference in the story,negative
821,absolutely breathtaking movie i watched in recent times everyone nailed it background score omg mind blowing by hans zimmer i wonder how denis villanueve managed to pull everything under million budget i am lack of words simply an masterpiece movie cinematography big thumbs up vfx big big thumbs timothee and zendaya they lived in their characters timothee he is in absolute beast mode in this movie to be honest after a long time i can see his potential and zendaya acting is lovable and beast mode performance chain character the way she delivered emotion love anger and caring is the best from zendaya do watch this movie in imax format you wont be disappointed for sure i watched this movie rd time and i love it,positive
822,cinematography is the highlight of this film and something that villenueve obviously does something very well i believe this is the best cinematography ive witnessed to date the sound and audio is incredible the riding of the sandworm will go down of one of the greatest imax scenes maybe ever hans zimmer and this soundtrack is too notch once again the acting and casting is unbelievable big name actors perform their way into their roles seamlessly the pacing of the movie is excellent consider its just under hours long this movie really has everything you could want in a film i believe this movie will go down as the greatest sequel of all time,positive
823,this was probably the fastest hours and minutes of my life i can see where all the hype is coming from this movie is absolutely amazing the visuals were beautiful the music was great and the acting was amazing just like in the first film except better storywise they did make some changes from the book some of those changes i actually liked and others i thought were a little odd they also cut out a lot of scenes plot lines and entire characters that were present in the book but wow this movie is a masterpiece if this doesnt end up being the best movie of then weve had a really good year for movies,positive
824,nothing can quite prepare you for this feast of the senses probably one of the best film sequels ever made this movie has everything you could possibly ask for breathtaking cinematography great acting fantastic script atmospheric film score and beautiful costumery the story continues from the first film and be prepared from pulsesetting action from the outset this is more of a fastmoving film from the first seriously switching the story up a gear with its stunning and beautiful visual aesthetics this spellbinding film transports you into another realm with painterly landscapes and seamless scifi effects as a lifelong star wars fan i can say this without any bias take note george lucas because this is how scifi films should be made,positive
825,a cinematic masterpiece denis villaneuves vision is a masterful and beautiful adaptation of this great story top tier on all levels this film had me hooked from beginning to end i loved every minute of it this was cinema and scifi at its best the scope was epic the shots were beautiful the characters are iconic and the music is captivatingthe world of dune has never felt more real and lived in the set design is beautiful and filled with details the characters are endearing and interestinghans has done it again with an amazing score that gave me chills and immersed me into the story from beginning to the enda perfect cinematography music story dialogue acting set design costume design vfx,positive
826,part one of villeneuves dune was following the book quite closely small changes that it made were probably for the best no one is going to miss lasguns liet was gender swapped for some reason that was the biggest unnecessary change that i can think of so it would make perfect sense that since first movie followed the book closely the second is going to do so toopart two is light years away from the book a bunch of characters have been changed completely aliya is not even born stilgar is nothing like stilgar from the books chani a side character from the books is now a central character in the plot in fact on most of the posters for the movie she is next to paul standing as high as him she even occludes him i guess every movie these days must have a girl boss zandaya is a bigger start that chalmet so studio was promoting her moredoes that mean that part two is a bad movie no its still well crafted and it actually manages to preserve the key ideas of the book i do think that part one was the better of the two though,positive
827,how the heck are there so many reviews for this this was a genuinely disappointing experience but first the good bits the audio is amazing and visually stunning but that is itthe entire finale was inevitable we are told it is inevitable from the beginning of the movie so there is no suspense throughout the entire thing it plays out exactly as expected paul is the chosen one some believe he is and others dont he is great at everything he does on the first try everyone is convinced to follow him anyway because he is great at everything they attack the bad guys the plan goes great and paul winswe as the audience do not feel the same suspense and payoff as the characters we know paul is alive so revealing him to other characters has no effect on us also the other characters like princess irulan and the bene gesserit are just assuming he is alive anyway so their actions are unaffected by his potential deathgurney returns and it is just an ok hes back they hug now they have gurney again i am okay not knowing the whole backstory of how he survived and i dont need to be spoonfed but we get about a minute of gurney doing his new thing until he bumps into paul and they hug it out at least gandalfs return in the two towers was fuelled by tension and foreshadowing and the characters were there for a reason for this it was just whelp another fremen attackoh and then gurney casually mentions they have nukes too if they want them another thing handed to paul on a silver platter which somehow is controversial for chani this brutal guerrilla fighter is suddenly like oh man i was all for killing people but this nuke situation bad dont do it paul but then that is it no more discussion about this atomic arsenal i dont even know if they used them in the final battle because the effect of the missiles they did use was not particularly atomicso while paul is busy being great at everything but also jon snowing it by saying but i dont want it rabban is having difficulty solving the fremen problem so we get introduced to feydrautha apparently the neville longbottom of the kwisatz haderach prophecy who we get to see be more psychopathic than his brother and a prime candidate to solve the fremen problem using his unique skillset of doing the exact same thing his brother was doing which is shelling the out of the desert but this time it just so happens that feydrautha shelled the correct place sietch tabr how did he know the right place no idea all we see as an audience is him doing the exact same thing his brother did great maybe show us that feydrautha is more competent instead of just telling us because licking knives and being a psychopath does not mean you are better at outthinking fremenso paul goes south which he did not want to do because he does not want to be mr prophecy man but now he has to so when he gets there he drinks the water of life that kills men but gives women memories of all their female ancestors and he finds out he is half harkonnen which is important why does he do this when he does not believe in the prophecy or want to be involved in it who knows maybe it is all a ruse maybe he does think he is the chosen one and has bluffed his way into being trusted sure it is nice to finish a movie with something to think about but the entire movie shouldnt be a complete tease with no payoffspeaking of finishing the movie the finale is paul and the fremen bait out the emperor they set a trap and the trap is jump out of the sand and charge great really using the fremen advantage here the fight could have been so clever but instead it was an artillery strike then a charge christso paul walks into the throne room kills grandfather baron harkonnen and challenges the emperor to single combat which is just so tiresome to see these days feydrautha volunteers to represent the emperor so paul and feydrautha try to knife each other feydrautha stabs paul but wait paul wins because he stabs feydrautha so i guess pauls stab was better than feydrauthas okay so the new bad guy with zero character development is deadit wasnt a terrible movie it was just unfulfilling it was beautiful both visually and audibly but the pacing was terrible we had too much detail for meaningless sections and not enough for others it is not a bad movie but it is definitely not materialalso the monty python life of brian reference please,positive
828,saw this at the imax hours ago part was on first min break and then part shown at on release dayjust absolutely stunning the cast is spot on the cinematography is spot on and the soundtrack is also spot on villeneuve has brought my favourite films right bang up to date im too tired to write any more at this point except to say that if you havent done bladerunner and dune parts yet then what are you doing treat yourselfdune is such an enthralling story in its own right it deserves to be transferred into the two films that it now occupies jodorosky had his go lynch had his go and now villeneuve has produced these gems i hope other film makers are paying attention theres so much tosh being produced at the moment but dune has rekindled my belief that there are still great moments to be had in film makinglong live the fighters,positive
829,enjoyed the first dune movie however the second one was all right but not as good it was way too long you should have cut at least minutes off of this thing zendaya is a horrible plank of wood actress and if you decreased her screen time to about of what it was it would have been a better movie the forced love story added nothing to this film and watching her on screen is irritating to say the least you could have easily taken out minutes of talking scenes that included her and paul and it would have sped the movie up a little bit just a note for any future sequels cut her roll down to next to nothing or remove her character entirely,positive
830,title says it all no script and substance in the movie just glittery production and soundscape as a teenager maybe id like it a bit the acting was sub par as well especially from timothee and zendaya the technology and the time does not make sense they have technology to have lasers and atomic bombs but not to improve their living conditions timothee does not die after being stabbed of course i understand its fiction but if you keep making things up the story just becomes something you recite to a small kid to make them fall asleep its level up your game people you have great people to work with like hans zimmer but the output is so bleh,positive
831,yes there are issues with this film especially the pacing at the endit felt too easy although epic part one felt like it was a tighter plot line while this was a string of vignetteseither way i really really enjoyed this film there is something about denis directing gregs cinematography hans score and the talent that make these films feel so real and so impactful ive rarely left the theater feeling so much enjoyment its a must see in imaxi started as a skeptic of the whole dune universe but now its one of my all time favorites would highly recommend this movie go see it,positive
832,finally a modern day epic that lives up to its loredenis villeneuve achieved several notable accomplishments firstly it successfully adapted frank herberts complex and beloved novel into a visually stunning and immersive cinematic experiencestunning visuals intricate worldbuilding and faithful interpretation of the source material additionally villeneuves direction skillfully balanced action politics and philosophy creating a rich narrative that appealed to both fans of the book and newcomers to the dune universe moreover the films cast including timothe chalamet rebecca ferguson and oscar isaac delivered compelling performances that brought the characters to life overall villeneuves dune must be hailed a masterpiecethis film delivers on every aspect of an epic the acting the cinematography the story all fantastic i struggle to find the superlatives to properly describe this movie the score is perfection the action scenes spectacular what the team behind this movie have done in terms of creating another world is unmatched in recent history it feels real,positive
833,cowritten and directed by denis villeneuve the story takes place right after the end of part one in which paul atreides unites with chani and the fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foreseeits kinda sad to remember that i am among those people who missed the opportunity to witness dune part one in the theatres however i just watched it out of curiosity because it looked promising and i didnt have the slightest clue what it was all about but what excites me about this kind of movie is that itll always get better every time you watch it again things become much clearer and thats when i hop on the dune bandwagon the sequel is just two times better in terms of well basically everything its kinda a privilege as a movie fan to get to experience a movie as immersive as this and oppenheimer two years in a row i guess this is what it feels like to live in the s s or even s when genredefining movies are born such as star wars because its the same genreso basically part one is just an introduction to all the characters motives the center of the story etc though id say it is a fair introduction rather than perfect because as i said before its definitely not an easy watch for everyone especially those who never read the book as for the sequel it really is a perfect continuation that takes us right back into the story and explores more about why it all happened in the first place both pauls and jessicas development are written perfectly without overlapping and leaving the other one weak as a result the performances of the actors and actresses were just perfect they played their parts perfectly though his screen time is short austin butlers feydrautha is definitely the one for me he gave it all out and was completely unrecognizableyou know what im out of words to describe just how goodlooking this movie is from the technical standpoint im just gonna say this if you like the first one you definitely gonna love this one,positive
834,wow just wow dune parts are the scifi epics we need in the modern day denis villeneuve brought us dune by frank herbert with such brilliance that im convinced he actually visited arrakis and i must eat humble pie since one of my few criticisms of part one was the lack of pauls visions but part two really dives head first into this bringing herberts story of a false messiah to lifespeaking of bringing to life here are my three favorite performances lady jessica played by rebecca ferguson rebecca perfectly captured my favorite character from dune nailing the loving mother and the scheming religious leader its unsurprising since she also made a fantastic bad guy in doctor sleep chani played by zendaya while chani was a good character from the novel villeneuves version has far more agency zendaya gives what i believe to be a career defining performance especially after paul drinks the water of life it was heartwrenching stuff man kudos all around paul atreides by timothe chalamet after seeing part one i read herberts genre redefining novel and i couldnt help but picture timothe as paul since the character description perfectly fits the actor however i wasnt sure if he could pull off the charismatic leader that he ended the novel as because i only saw him as the young man burdened by the weight of prophecy but chalamet delivers and i would throw myself at a horde of sardaukar for him usul muaddibin conclusion denis villeneuve simultaneously honors the book and crafts an epic scifi action movie that anyone can enjoy i also found it impressive how much i was still rooting for paul even when i knew where his story ended there really is a power to film be well fellow scifi guys long live the fighters,positive
835,the acting was the first thing i applauded it was very effective the actors filled in the personalities of each character their overall tone of dialogue matched the motivations they had like how lady jessica is being more manipulative than ever rebecca ferguson was a phenomenal actress zendaya also shined her characters desperation for saving paul was heartbreaking and she nailed the right emotions for chani and timothe chalamet is a very versatile actor i love every movie he is into the scene where he spoke to the fremen underground as the lisan al gaib gave me chills even though the movie felt hotsecond are the visual effects as a cinephile who always looks for the visuals of a film this movie outshined itself it captured the whole environment depicted in the novel series it was a breathtaking experience because it is quite rare to watch movies that were taken in a deserted place taking place in a different world the appearance of the sandworm or shaihulud made an impact its colossal magnitude shook the whole theater like i was there riding it the scenes in giedi prime were cool including the battle scene with feyd with its brutalist architecture and the monochrome color grading its so atmosphericwith the ability of hans zimmer to describe emotions through music the score resonates with the mystique of the dune universe it triggers awe for something so unworldly but mixed with a warning of imminent danger it totally fits the movies narrativethe writing also still landed the great pacing connected it to the previous film and made a path for the movies direction i sat for hours straight and never felt any boredom at all it made me more excited the buildup to the climax was crazy fleshing out new characters and adding them for more political turmoil and hindrances up to the final battle between paul and feyd it was intense and menacingthe mixture of realworld cultures of middle eastern countries blends well with the theme of the movie which was all about foreign colonizers using fear and faith as their tool to control the theme made me question my reality how are we going to believe are we just going to wait until a prophecy is fulfilled or are we going to make it a reality the movie warned me about the danger that a false belief could posethank you denis villeneuve for carrying the new generation of scifi genre films and the whole of hollywood itself all the movies you have made have had an impact on me which inspires me to be a filmmaker someday,positive
836,dune part one was my favourite movie of originally slated to be released in november of last year this second instalment was delayed due to the sagaftra strike so it was with bated breath that i saw it last night in imaxdune is a masterpieceit has been a very long time since a movie has left me speechlessit is denis villeneuves magnum opus very much like how christopher nolan crowned his career with oppenheimer last year this is villeneuves greatest ever moviesimilar to peter jacksons the lord of the rings the return of the king dune represents another evolution of cinema as an art form i dont use that word lightlythis is the true definition of a vice movie see types of movies tab at the top of homepage the story locks you in from the opening frame and at just minutes shy of hours this movie absolutely flies by not once during its runtime was i boredthe only downside is my cinema going adventures of has peaked with dune part two nothing will compare to this movie for the rest of the yearlets have a catch upthe story picks up literally in the same frame as part one ended dune part one and dune part two have to be seen as one movie split into two this is not a sequel if part one was the starter this is the main course it makes the first movie betterpaul atreides chalamet cements his position on arrakis he along with his mother jessica ferguson who herself becomes the revered mother start to foresee a prophecy that paul or to give him is fremen name usul will become the saviour of the planet to reflect this paul gives himself the name of muaddib a powerful name on arrakismeanwhile after baron harkonnen continues to lose his grip on arrakis thanks to the losses at the hands of those rats the freman and the incompetence of his unstable nephew beast rabben batista the baron calls his beloved other nephew feydrautha butler up to the plate to retake the planet in his families name and setting the scene for warso the best way to review this movie because of its immensity is to break it down here goescinematographyevery aspect of how this movie looks is frankly staggering dp greig fraser not only makes each frame look like a stunning photograph his use of camera angles lighting and the natural environment is amazing the battle scenes are jaw dropping and the sense of scale especially the sand worms in imax is eye watering i had spine tingles for most of the moviesound and scorethe sound is incredible as i saw it in imax which i implore you to do if able leaves you shaken in your seat you will never forget where and when you first saw and heard those sand worms the score by the legendary composer hans zimmer is equally superb and is used to amazing effectcastas for the cast each member of the star studied lineup absolutely bring their a game to the table this movie makes timothe chalamet a man gone is the petulant son of duke leto atreides oscar isaac i think chalamet is fast becoming this generations dicaprio zendaya was equally superb as his partner chiani as she continues to show that she is one of the leading actresses of her geneartionafter his breakout role in elvis and apple tv series masters of the air austin butler is a revelation as the psychopathic feydrautha beloved nephew to baron harkonnenno country for old men alum josh brolin and javier bardem resume their respective roles as gurney halleck and stilgar offering gravitas and wise council to the younger cast who take centre stageflorence pugh as the emperors daughter princess irulan is excellent as is the great veteran actor christopher walken in a small but pivotal role as the emperormy only complaint as such is that dave batistas character beast rabben felt under served and was reduced to a bit of a one note character screaming out orders whilst slipping further out of the good graces of his uncle on that subject baron harkonnen skarsgard himself so central to the original film is also somewhat side lined in this second part of the movieactionwhilst i in no way shared this sentiment there were some people who said dune part one was boring and lacked action the same cannot be said for this continuing instalmentthe action in this movie is breathtakingly shot and choreographed whether it was wide scale battles or hand to hand combat it felt exhilarating organic and primalspecial effectsa seamless blend of top drawer cgi and jaw dropping practical effects effortlessly combined with filming on location in abu dhabiimpact on cinemadune part one and dune part two is this generations star wars it however goes further than that it is star wars for grownups there is nothing disney has done with star wars to rival or even come close to villeneuves incredible movie it makes the recent mcu and dc movies look what they are light

837,i was really looking forward to see this movie i liked the first one and the old one from i dont want to say that but the film is a fart in the wind instead of a thunderlike villeneuves bladerunner the optics and style are awesome however the characters and plot give the impression of depth where is none in the end the same disappointment when the movie comes to its conclusion the fact there might be a part does not change thatwhat are the big flaws of dune part two paul is shown as humble and only wants to help he is aware of the dangers of beeing a messiah only to go full megalomania once he drinks the water of life and the final battle is underwhelming no real struggle to win no clever descissions to turn the tide no new weapons or ships to see other characters are even worse yes the emperor is supposed to be weak but he is so dull that its impossible to belive he made it to such a high age in this position vladimir harkonnen was dangerous and terrifying in part one now he is shown to be strangely submissive when facing a joke of an emperor and his nephew who might become his successor that doesnt fit his character at all feydrautha harkonnen has to fight drugged opponents in the colosseum and a doctor suddenly he is the big scary final boss the fremen were the good guys where paul was supposed to grow together with and fight for them to give them a better future now it feels like they are nothing more like some native tribe who is manipulated with witchcraft to be a tool of power for the next emperorthere are several other points but these are the most important reasons why the pretty pictures are not enough to make this film satisfying to watchlike john carter of mars nice to see but so very meh at the end,positive
838,hype is such a dangerous thing as it opens the door to tremedous let down denis villeneuves opus is the polar opposite beyond expectations is what he and his amazing team have achieved the godfather of dune even better than the first what struck me so often in this film was though the dune novels was the inspiration for so many syfy stories novels films you would expect some amount of oh i have seen that before but in villeneuves hands he delivers originality i expect the film will do to films what the books originally did its a master class it there is any thing to criticize is the jumps in the story from time to time but it doesnt matterbecause the blanks get filled in just like a torture scene or love scene where not everything is shown ur imagination is allowed to do the rest as for hans zimmers score oscar in the bag he has once again raised the bar on the word epic this film is going to walk away with every award for score and sound editing and cinematography,positive
839,i like both episodes and it is better than the first episode of the sequel but i am still a bit clueless at some parts of the story certain parts seem slack and not expalined while other parts are suddenly fasten and jumping a lot scenes sound visuals are amazing but cannot feel connected to non of the characters story is a bit slow despite it is interesting could bear more action than minutes from the hours minutes overall it is great would watch it another time but cannot compare to star wars universe currently reflecting on the comparisons on i have read but if they open up this galaxy in upcoming parts then it could be a relevant competitor among the names in the scifi fantasy sector,positive
840,dune part two definitely is impressive visually with a great musical score the sound effects alone are remarkable and very loud specially watching it at dolby theatreand thats about it really the overall plot was lacking big time without spoiling anything its strongly based on prophecy and leadership its very similar to many of the well known historical stories of prophets and their messages their rise to leadership and power unlike history however the story buildup is weak the script lacks originality and the whole he is the one scenario have been utilized so many times in films for eg the matrix there are no high stakes whether or not the protagonist is the one has no major consequences or at least the script failed to highlight itthe movie still has some very solid moments like the introduction of the main villain with the black and white scenes is fantastic in fact the scenes with villains were more amusing than the protagonistsacting is decent but nothing spectacular zendaya has basically the same angry impression throughout without any clear reason why she needs to train and work harder on her skillstimothee chalamant is slightly better but not very impressive dave bautista is under utilized and both his character and chalamants scream too much its distractingspeaking of loud there was also plenty of shouting from the villagers i think they are called fremen chanting words like lasan algaib and modeb these two words probably consumed half the script repeated over and over it is exhaustingi know the director wanted to reflect some authenticity with the languages but the frequent shifting between english and fremen or whatever its called was another distractionprobably the chemistry between zendaya and chalamant are the worst ive ever seen i am not sure if its their acting or the script but it felt forced and predictableas mentioned earlier musical score and sounds effects are the highlight of the movie superb and transfers you into the film as if we are in it same with the visuals the color gradient and atmosphere sucks you into the world of dune its such an experience but after a while one wants a story arc to keep ones interest high which lackedi would probably say the costume design department is the best definitely impressive style and unique costume designs for almost all characters could be nominated for best costume designaction scenes were loud and impressive but lacked tension because as i mentioned there are no high stakes for our protagonist losing not to mention battle scenes are brief and felt rushed i was expecting epic battles with strategies and action sequences something like star wars or lord of the rings but there is no emphasis or focus on the battle scenes specifically the final battle sceneso yeah it is ok with some memorable scenes but left me generally disappointed and i think its over hyped i do recall liking the first movie more it could have at least be shorter than hours minutes or some better choreography and tension in battles scenes a little less emphasis on the prophecy angle,positive
841,this movie is absolutely breathtaking from start to finish the character development is incredible the depth of the movie is fantastic you can feel like you are part of something big and you can see the power of words plenty of great references to human history denis villeneuve is building a great legacy this trilogy will probably beat lord of the ring as the best trilogy ever made the only bad thing about this movie is that now we need to wait to see the third one hopefully this box office success will change denis villeneuve mind on waiting a while to produce the third one and decide to go on the project right away,positive
842,this movie really does take what dune part one does great and do it just as well and in some cases better the acting is superb the visuals and cinematography are amazing the musiclack thereof enhances scenes i absolutely love the costumes there is so much to like ive never read the books i havent seen the s movie i even only recently saw part one going in blind still has blown me away some movies really struggle to immerse you and make you feel like a fictional world could be real this movie is not onetimothee really steals the show for me once he comes back to life he really seemed untouchable and has a commanding presence the duel between him and nabaron was intense and i loved how there wasnt any music for that fight the worm riding scene was so cool too heck i thought chani showing paul how to properly sand walk was great the shot with the close up of her feetthe only knocks i have against this movie are when paul is supposed to survive in the desert alone then shortly meets chani then suddenly theyre out with a bunch of fremen taking on a spice harvester it seemed as though they rushed paul and chanis relationship a bit also when paul doesnt want to go south but then decides to he ends up drinking the life water did he need to do that im not sure if that was explained or if i missed it some of the harkenen scenes with the coliseum as well as the shots of the army didnt have the greatest special effects to me but that mightve been intentionaloverall the few problems i had with the movie really arent that big of a deal i saw it in imax which was a good idea im looking forward to being able to see this again to me this is more of a might end up changing it to a after another viewing we will see highly recommended,positive
843,wow what a film i havent see a sequel better than the original since empire strikes back from the cinematography the score and stacked cast of actors this film was everything in one there were a few times i was on the edge of my seat and there were a few twists that i did not expect the action scenes were perfectly executed and the visuals were amazing throughout you can tell they trained hard on the choreography and took there time with this one the acting was great and how they showcased each planet looked beautiful the film also had a great story line that was easy to follow along i am very excited to see how the trilogy will finish up,positive
844,this movie makes you believe that cinema is still alive the overall styling visuals atmosphere are phenomenal the storytelling characters and music are nearing perfection everything in the movie transpires attention to detail action and battle scenes are well balanced and it is never boring many of the scenes are truly unique and powerful the movie has close to no defaultsthis is an absolute must see for anyone that even remotely enjoys science fiction movies i was on the edge of tears coming out of the screening room after such an epic display of cinema like we rarely see anymore kudos to denis villeneuve this is genius level,positive
845,dune part two is not what i expected i went into this movie thinking it would be some sort of high octane action movie but it really isnt this movie prioritises the the technical side of cinema to grant the scale and profound meaning to the movie and i love it the music the colours the wide shots it all crescendos to the perfect cliff hanger at the end and unlike part one i felt fulfilled and satisfied with where this movie left its charactersthrought this movie i felt a sense of awe in that i was witnessing cinema history before me usually when i go to the cinema its because i want to have a fun hours out in town but this movie felt like an occasion whilst it was fun hell i would say its some of the most fun ive had at the cinema it was more this movie really stood to show you what you can do with a camera a script and some stunning vfx and isnt this what the movies are for its artwork put into the big screen dune part two despite its blockbuster nature is art and this is why you need to go see it,positive
846,after watching part over over patiently waiting for this release i can say i was completely mesmerized from the cinematography to the sound to the plots thrills we were blown away i had high expectations this ticked every boxa few deviations from the book like most movies have but replaced with nothing short of great rewritesmy better half can barely sit through a minute episode he couldnt take his eyes off the big screen claimed it the best movie he has ever seenits a must watch i truly hope some awards go up for grabs for the visually pleasing immersive film,positive
847,i will keep it short just like the harkonnens in this movie in the first one we saw their power and in the second one it felt like it was brushed off quickly like out of nowhere they beat them so easy and quickly the movie in the beginning gave me the feeling that the cousin of the baron was going to be this biggest bad guy where he will do such big evil things and be a big challenge for paul which clearly he was not and wasnt shown often even the baron and rabban was not shown often expected more they died too quickly and too easy and i dont know if they had to keep the movie short but i felt like they should have put more power and time in to the main characters it went by way too fast in my opinion like they were in a rush the first movie was nice and slow intense and beautiful scenes this one felt like a quickie paul received super powers immediately and had the emperor on his knees an emperor which we barely saw only had a few scenes we can count on one hand also at the end i expected a tougher battle an emperor showing up with a few hundreds of soldiers didnt make any sense was so easy overthrown they could have make it more exciting i mean it wasnt a bad movie it was enjoyable just very fast they should have put at least half an hour or more in the film and take their time with the characters pauls mother the emperor the harkonnens maybe some epic lines that pauls father said in the previous one more dialogue at the end didnt avenge his father enough it was in and out anyways good movie i hope the next one they will take their time more,positive
848,long time dune fan read the books as a kid watched the movies over the yearsand this one cements denis villeneuve as the proper custodian for this tale this time aroundthe actors are amazing even though im still a bit on the fence about timothythe score is perfect it along with the visuals truly makes this movie so perfectbut what truly sold me was when watching it in the theater and the worm ride scene came oni caught myself moving and squinting like i was there in the sceneit was glorious a must have experience that can only be delivered on the big screensure the movie changes some things but i dont mind as i feel that is to ensure a more fulfilling rd partsee it in the theater,positive
849,dune part is a bigbudget film filmed in coproduction between countries the united states canada the united arab emirates hungary jordan new zealand italy and the gambia resulting in an extraordinary production of great proportions the cast is topnotch and gives remarkable performances timothe chalamet zendaya rebecca ferguson florence pugh austin butler javier bardem christopher walken charlotte rampling stellan skarsgrd dave bautista and josh brolin shine in every scene demonstrating their histrionic abilities denis villeneuves work as a director is excellent demonstrating his talent behind the cameras the adaptation of the chapters taken to film from the book dune by frank herbert are scripted by denis villeneuve himself together with jon spaihts resulting in an epic story although in some scenes it becomes long and in others it becomes very precipitated the technical elements such as cinematography sound design costume design editing and special effects are majestically achieved and are a visual delight although dune part is a great film it falls short of being a complete masterpiece and despite the critical praise that considers it superior to its predecessor that is exaggerated as a result the film is incredible and visually stunning,positive
850,am i the only one who found this movie flat yes there is spectacle but theres spectacle in transformers as well this is by far villeneuves most marvelish movie i dont know how i can love the first part so much and just find the second part so utterly boring it is so hard to care about any of the characters and there was so so much in the book that could should have been used to make the plot more interesting im really confused because i was expecting a more canonic movie with shifting alliances and a deeper dive into the mythology of the bene gesserit alias part was a joke it was just such a gimmick where im the book its so so essential to the overarching conflict between the atreides kwisatz gaderach and bene gesserit factions there was so much there this version for me was way too streamlined im glad everyone else liked it though,positive
851,permit me to start off by saying this film was so beautifully introduced by the first one i had anxiety when it was nearing completion because it would be over villeneuve once again tells a story using sound vibrations colour and technology in a flawless way the performances by chalamet zendaya and skaarsgard were impeccable the performance that stood out for me was butlers i genuinely feared his character and he made me uncomfortable of course coupled with villeneuves art i would recommend anyone to watch this its a beautiful story that is told so well you will be left wanting more,positive
852,very rare i hand out a but honestly i cant find a single fault with this film every aspect top to bottom is perfect i could sit here for ages telling you about all the things that came together to make this film as great as it however i think i would be wasting your time instead all i am going to do is tell you to watch it because i can guarantee you this film will blow you away my expectations going in were already really high and somehow this film exceeded them far behind i could even comprehenddenis villeneuve has just reached god level and i can very confidential sit him in the same category with the likes of christopher nolan stanley kubrick martin scorsese etc easily best film of the year and i will be extremely surprised if this one gets topped by end of the year,positive
853,dune captivated me from every angle the music sets imagery costumes intense scenes acting and suspense were all exceptionalthe storytelling unfolded scene by scene with a masterful buildup of slower moments executed flawlesslyif possible i would rate it beyond a perfect it stands out as the best movie ive seen in years and im sure will see for a long timei had very high expectations as i really enjoyed the first dune remake this movie exceeded them allits genuinely incredible i suggest everyone go and see dune whilst in the cinema its truly a masterpiece in my opinion,positive
854,i thought it was very good i only have bad opinions the ending of zendaya leaving when the emperor kissed pauls ring and the other is the lack of participation of florence pugh for the rest it is the best movie i saw in the cinematimothee chalamet is the best actor in the world at only years austin butler as a villain he is excellent how he uses his body and voice to command respect zendaya she truly surprised me he gave a phenomenal performance as chani and manages to convey that feeling of pain and disappointment when paul accepts the hand of the emperors daughter and it made me really want to see what will happen with his story and very good performance rebecca ferguson and javier bardemdenis villeneuve hes on his way to oscars and glory hanz simmer did it again he is the best at what he doesfor all that for me it is a but we round it to,positive
855,just saw it a second time in imaxthe first time i was blown away by the visuals the aesthetics the grandeur and fascinated by the storythe second time i was blown away by the emotional weight of the story and its charactersboth times this film evoked strong emotions at the risk of displaying recency bias i feel comfortable putting this film in my top films of all timei will legitimately be sad when this movie leaves the theaters specifically due to the tremendous nature of the imax experience no home theater will be able to touch its scope and grandeur im afraidtake a bow denis take a bow,positive
856,this movie completely exceeded my expectations i was captivated by the story the characters the world that was built beautifully by dennis villeneuvei dont want to give too much away but what i will say is that the last time i experienced such entertainment in a cinema was from watching the dark knight this movie is at that exact same level i am hooked and cannot wait to see the next installment bring on dune part the cinematography and soundtrack complimented each other like cheese wine it helped set the mood to an already incredibly impressive story this movie was all i could ask for to a sequel to dune part dennis villeneuve will have me anticipating all of his movies from here on out thanks for reading,positive
857,a summary of my dune part review the reason to see this is its looks it is i apologize a feast for the eyes plotwise weve got warring intergalactic families fighting over the rights to the universes most important mineral spice we have a good son with a mysterious mother weve got evil villains harkonnens and a rebel army fremen with pet worms standing guard even so better to lower your expectations the giant worms aint that much the bald villains are too easy confused with one another david bautista is the one recognized villain but hes weak in his role the film is somber morbid heavy not a light moment throughout its long running timedune part is better first the plot is more compelling the reasons for events in part are explained here there is a love angle between the good son paul atreides timothee chalamet and a young fremen woman chani zendaya which relieves the solemnity in fact the very presence of zendayas character lifts the film mightily she is without question someone to care aboutjavier bardem is great as the leader of the fremen josh brolin is rousing as chalamets protector austin butler as the psychopathic nextinline for the throne receives an a for creepiness a compliment christopher walken is wasted as the emperor who is no pun wasting away why he was chosen for this role beats me florence pugh as his daughter is simply there her character is a sometimes narrator the sometimes element simply confusing overall there is an aura of selfimportance about dune as though the viewer will take away an important lesson but again the heaviness the weight of the characters unhappiness overpowers the good that might be derivedin part many of these characters have secrets as well as secret motives though i for one was never quite sure about whose motives with the exception of chanis were worth rooting for the special effects here were disappointing the worms were an improvement over part though seriously i wanted to see more of them ascertain how large they are see them compared to other large structures but no i was never enthusiastic about the interstellar spacecraft they appear more like a deck of playing cards than a speedy conveyancebottom line part is a good film however id be perfectly fine if there were no part,positive
858,this is a great film in so many different ways the cinematography is some of the best ive seen in a long time i did not see austin butlerhe was bought into his role as feyd so well that i couldnt take my eyes off of him when he was on screen rebecca fergusons performance was so nuanced and subtle it gave me goosebumps at times and the endingpowerful and heartbreaking all at once well done this is a master class in epic filmmaking and hits all the right spots one of the rare occasions when ive walked out of a theater and wanted to walk right back in and watch the film again the only thing that wouldve made this better is if i couldve watched part one as a double feature,positive
859,spoilers have been waiting awhile over years actually like everyone else for director villeneuves continuation with dune and was not disappointed dune is a formidable and at times spectacular cinema i will say i liked its predecessors pacing better than this one whose finale seemed a bit anticlimactic and off kilter the stylized visuals give way to a cramped and darklit final set that seemed like a stage play oddly a bit out of place from some earlier beautiful and intricate set designs catching this on imax though was certainly worthwhile though javier bardem fills in for the life and energy of the movie somewhat similar to jason momoa in the earlier film easily the best scene of the movie for me was the earlier fight scene with harkonnen harvester ground troops and paul and chani in serious battle the fight choreography and melding of visual affects and sound was absoluately stunning and st rate putting even the empire strikes back hoth effects to shame was overall pleased with this entry and looking forward to villeneuves next picture hopefully science fiction got the feelling more dune will be on the way looking forward to it give it a,positive
860,how this got its a rating is a miracle the film has war obviously as its central theme but it moves away from your traditional battle scenes with some really dark and unnecessary killings strangely enough i felt uneasy and creeped out by the religious tone of the film it felt very close watching a film about an evil cult this movie doesnt flow its disjointed and unrealistic i learned nothing and felt tricked that the story still hadnt ended i didnt enjoy this film at all zendaya spends nearly every scene gurning for the camera timothee isnt convincing as a strong man to lead or fight rebecca is just pouting all the time and creepy as hell josh brolin has about minutes of dialogue christopher is being propped up by a stick i could go on but i wont,negative
861,i think we are really lucky to be living in a time where we can witness such a greatness of a movie this was a masterpiece everything was incredible the cinematography the dialogue this story with paul and the fremen arrakis the acting was outstanding and for me its a oscar worthy performance from thimothe chalamet for me its the best movie of the decade if not the best movie of all time the score is incredible every sound effect makes the movie epic and the score for me is one of the things that makes this movie so good aswell if you like a world where they have their on language where actors give it their all with a touching and epic story with loads of action and good dialogue go watch it please,positive
862,you sit in the theater and h m just rush by the plot is dense so many things happen in this movie that it almost feels bit to quickly narrated at times albeit never rushed the reason why nothing feels rushed is due to the unparalleled visual spectacle that is dune part two largescale battles dense fight scenes but also sweeping landscape shots and closeup moments between characters are all set into scene so stunningly i truly think its the best looking scifi movie of all time and not only the cinematography is breathatking and epic everything around it is too the costumes the epic soundtrack and espcially the sound design the whole sensory experience is so weighty and wellbuilti also appreicate the daring choices of color grading which give the movie a welcome artistic elementfor me dune part two got stronger as it progressed while some character arcs were told a bit quick they did make sense in the end and lead to a morethanepic climax and conclusion i really hope a part three will be greenlit i feel like i am anything but tired of watching the world of dune unfold out of denis villeneuves hands,positive
863,are you excited for some thrilling scifi action well get ready to be blown away as the highly anticipated dune part two has finally arrived and its an absolute masterpiece this movie is an absolute treat for any scifi enthusiast its stunning visuals are breathtaking and transport you to a completely different world altogether the action sequences are so intense that they will keep you glued to your seat and the story is so gripping that you will be left craving for more the amount of detail that has gone into every aspect of the film is remarkable and speaks volumes about the hard work that has gone into its making the cast delivers outstanding performances that are sure to leave a lasting impression on you overall watching this movie is an experience that you wouldnt want to miss so dont miss out on the excitement and experience this incredible journey for yourself,positive
864,dune part delivers a cinematic spectacle like no other denis villeneuves vision transcends boundaries crafting an instant classic that immerses viewers in a universe beyond imagination the films grand scale and breathtaking visuals set a new standard for epic storytelling from the very beginning youre drawn into a world where characters and their identities are expertly primed making for a deeply engaging narrativewhat truly sets dune part apart is its ability to blend depth scale drama spectacle and humor creating a movie experience that resonates with adult audiences seeking substance and sophistication its a refreshing departure from the formulaic tropes of frequent franchises and hollywood blockbusters offering a polished cinematic gem destined to withstand the test of timethe sound design is nothing short of extraordinary with hans zimmers score elevating every scene to new heights after watching youre left with an exhilarating sensation akin to finishing a thrilling ride a testament to the films immersive power dune part stands as a remarkable achievement a cinematic masterpiece that boldly challenges recent disney productionsprepare to be mesmerized as this is a movie youll want to experience again and again dune part is a triumph in every sense of the wordthank you denis for this masterpiece,positive
865,its always difficult to bring a sci fi novel to the big screen and after a successful first film the second blew it out water story cast cinematography soundtrack moments of humour the emotions the film takes you through breathtaking probably a modern day classic which will be talked about for decades to come thoroughly enjoyed the movie and it didnt feel as long as it stated i could have continued watching this was a dramatic pulsating story of good vs evil a story we we are witnessing today the very definition of david and goliath incredible film wow blown away from the visuals,positive
866,this is a mystical movie nt star wars the messiah is in most civilisations very well acted and locations are excellent the backdrop to the movie is water water in our world is becoming more precious and precarious not in northern ireland but further south along the mediterranean and around the world timothee is excellent in the main role obviously there is going to be sequel really enjoy the film but remember francesca annis in the original francesca was more human as the mother figure but all the actors in this sequel were excellent will definitely go to see the dune very well directed by villennuehighly recommend to anybody go see,positive
867,i gonna be brief after seeing this movie one thing i know for sure villeneuve is not a good screenwriter not at allhe is a mster of visual time due to the mature of his visual skills a hours movie feels fast very easy to see but even a child could wrote the dialogues of this movie the story is full of blind spotsalso ive missed some room for the supernatural and mystical essence that is present into the original bookrest value to the movieremarkabl javier bardem and austin butler perfomings both of then are the true pillars wich save somehow the storya good film spectacle not a msterpiece,positive
868,wow dune part two blew us away its easily one of the greatest scifi films ever made everything about it was amazingthe story flowed seamlessly from part one and even though its nearly three hours long it didnt feel like it the pacing was perfect and we were hooked from start to finishthe special effects were incredibly realistic and the actors portrayed their characters brilliantly the chemistry between them felt genuine and nothing seemed fake or forceddirector denis villeneuve did an outstanding job and the action scenes were mindblowing the sound in imax was incredible making the experience even more immersivehans zimmers score was masterful and it added so much to the film overall dune part two is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves all the praise its gettingif youre a fan of scifi dont miss this movie its truly something special and will leave you in awe,positive
869,im not sure why i see all these posts calling for dune part to be a masterpiece certainly it has the casting and production value to be great but upon watching it is such a let down compared to the first as a director i love denis villeneuve but i feel like hes squandering his directorial might on dune you cant just have amazing scenery and soundtrack without plot and scriptwriting to back it up which it does not to me this is another indication that hollywood has lost its way trending towards visuals over plot im intrigued as to how they plan to salvage the franchise with part but i think film enthusiasts need to be sceptical how does a movie so lack lustre get such great reviews reviews that were better than the first are critics being paid off or are they brainwashed doesnt make much sense to me,positive
870,no seriously didnt understand any of itfour of us watched none of us read the books etc yet all four of us took turns basically every minutes to ask is anyone understanding thisits up there with probably the worst example of cinematic storytelling as if the director assumed there was no need to explain the incredibly complex parts to the story and not only that introduced new complexities in such regular fashion that it was simply impossible to keep upas others have said it was quite simply boring also basically monochrome or better yet sepia tone entire movie was purposefully shot in sand tones no it didnt feel immersive just magnified the dull experienceacting was also very poor but im not focusing there as its really hard to truly evaluate when youve got no idea what they are talking about to judge how they deliver it,negative
871,that was fantastic hans zimmers score was incredible and each scene took me on a journey through different parts of my brain it sparked so many memories thanks for this amazing cinematic experiencei also loved the movies exploration of undiscovered potential within the human mind it seems like they were hinting at that throughout the film im even more intrigued to see where the story leadswhile i might have gotten a bit confused and thought this was part one i cant wait to watch the entire trilogy in one sitting someday im new to this universe but as i said to my friend thats star wars for adults,positive
872,dune holds a special place in my heart as one of my alltime favorite books that has never received the same level of mainstream attention that the star wars universe has which is some sort of cosmic irony considering how much star wars lore owes to the dune novels and also to jodorowskys dune disclaimer i am an unabashed star wars fanatic please dont take this as a slight towards my favorite fandom much like the star wars vs dune conundrum when it comes to popularity denis villeneuve is one of my favorite directors who holds a special place in my heart because he has made a lot of great movies that unfortunately havent been box office sensations another modern director that he often gets compared to is christopher nolan who unlike denis not only makes great movies but has had a lot more financial box office hits while i am extremely happy for nolan especially since i rank him high on my favorite directors list denis villeneuve continues to bring out the inner scifi nerd in me because he has arguably been the best scifi director of the st century scifi when done right is my favorite genre of fiction whether it be books video games tv shows or movies up until this point denis had made four straight films that were deemed hits by audiences and critics alike but he never did reach mega boxoffice success i couldnt be happier with the success that dune part has hadthe day was saturday march and i was finally going to see my most anticipated movie since dune dune part one as i sunk into the plush theater seat i was swept up by a wave of nostalgia mixed with anticipation the metallic voice of the sardaukar pierced the silence uttering those immortal words power over spice is power over all with that we were whisked back to arrakis and got to experience for the next hours and minutes one of the most influential stories of the scifi genre finally being told in a way that would be accessible to most audiencesfrom this point on there will be spoilers to both the book and the film belowdunes accessibility to a broader audience marked a significant departure from some of the more intricate aspects of the original story for instance in frank herberts novel alia pauls sister is portrayed as a preternaturally gifted child who ages rapidly due to her exposure to the spice mlange in the womb while also receiving the knowledge of all of the reverend mothers before receiving any agency herself however in villeneuves adaptation alia is reimagined as a fetus communicating telepathically with lady jessica her mother this alteration not only simplifies alias character arc but even more importantly it saves denis villeneuve the trouble of having to find a toddler actress that not only is capable of quality acting but also has parents who would be comfortable enough with letting their little girl crawlwalk around a movie set and then have the task of stabbing and killing barron harkonnen good luck casting departmentanother way that denis elected to make the film more accessible to modern audiences was with the portrayal of fremen culture while herberts novel meticulously details their strict customs and rituals including the practice of water discipline and the importance of the sietch fremen underground dwellings villeneuves adaptation opts for a more simplified approach that focuses more on showing us that the fremen adapted to the desert without telling us how to everything which for a film is almost always the correct approach the film emphasizes themes of unity cooperation and resistance against oppression showcasing the fremen as a fiercely independent and resourceful people but the biggest thing that the film changes about fremen culture is that they portray the fremen as a society where men and women are seen as equals whereas in the book paul goes through a ritualistic transfer of ownership after defeating jamis in single combat acquiring his wife and children in the process purists will of course be upset with this alteration but i think denis made this change to make us empathize with the fremen and highlight the contrast with outdated customs upheld by the empire and the bene gesserit such as the transfer of power through marriage as seen with princess irulan with the adaptations alterations in mind lets delve into the performances of the cast who brought these reimagined characters to life on the screentimothy chalamets portrayal of paul atreides was nothing short of remarkable his every scream every whispered command felt like a visceral punch thanks to the impeccable sound editing that transported us directly into the heart of arrakis its almost as if paul was wielding the voice compelling us to follow his every move paul emerges as a more relatable and empathetic figure grappling with the weight of destiny and the burden of leadership he finds himself torn between the survival of his people and the potential devastation of billions the conflict between his personal desires and his duty to the fremen his family and the entire universe is palpable in chalamets portrayal this was the level of acting and writing i wish was present for anakin skywalker in the film star wars episode iii revenge of the sith thankfully matthew stovers novelization of the film does the story justice and i cant recommend it enough for any star wars fan out there it truly blows that film awaybut anyway back to dune chalamet skillfully navigates pauls journey portraying him as a man trapped by fate forced to confront his own mortality and the inevitable consequences of his actions what sets chalamets performance apart is his ability to convey pauls internal struggle and conflicting emotions he portrays a character who must reconcile his own desires with the greater good knowing that his choices will shape the fate of worlds ultimately chalamets portrayal of paul atreides elevates the character to new heights imbuing him with humanity and complexity and i am excited to see where his character goes in the upcoming dune messiah movieaustin butlers feyd rautha practically leapt off the screen with intensity and i loved every scene that he was in his portrayal of the barons lovely feyd seamlessly embodied the ferocity and cunning nature of house harkonnen delivering a performance that leaves a lasting impression from his commanding presence in the electrifying introduction on giedi prime to his pivotal role in the intricate plots of the bene gesserit butler captures the essence of feyds character with intensity and depth and he just looked like he was having the time of his life playing the sociopathic villain though as great as austin butler was what truly makes the character of feyd so memorable is the meticulous setup crafted by denis villeneuve in the books on top of being a monstrous figure baron vladimir harkonnen was heavily implied to be a pedophile that had a sexual preference for young men and was particularly attracted to his nephew feyd he explained to feyd that all of his schemes and the chaos he unleashed was for feyd to take over house harkonnen and to ascend to the throne of the emperor this intricate web of plans within plans adds depth to the barons character positioning him as a master manipulator to set feyd rautha up as a rival for paul while the book delves deeper into the nuances of the barons character the film amplifies feyd rauthas threat portraying him as a significant player in the power dynamics of the dune universeprior to the audiences introduction feyd we see princess irulan having a conversation with the reverend mother shedding light on the intricate power dynamics at play revealing the bene gesserits plan for the succession to the throne irulan learns that the only way for the shaddam family to retain power is through marriage she is presented with two potential suitors paul whom the bene gesserit are determined to prevent from ascending and feyd rautha whom irulan protests is a sociopath however the bene gesserit are undeterred by feyds character flaws they are solely interested in determining if he can be controlled because they know that they cannot control paulenter giedi prime the planet with a black sun that absorbs all color the scene on giedi prime is a masterclass in visual storytelling shot with infrared cameras to emphasize the stark brutality of the harkonnen home world it immerses viewers in a world of darkness and danger amidst this backdrop feyd rauthas character shines embracing the challenge of combat with a sociopathic zeal his fight is not just a display of physical prowess but a testament to his formidable nature and unyielding determination feyd relished every moment of the brutal combat showcasing a level of derangement that even for a harkonnen was chillingly uniqueafter the battle was over we encounter the steadfast lady fenring a stark contrast to the defiant lady jessica where jessica chose to defy the bene gesserits plans by bearing a son paul lady fenring embodies unwavering dedication to their schemes her relentless commitment to the bene gesserit cause stands in sharp contrast to jessicas independent spirit and serves the purpose of letting the audience know of how deep the bene gesserits manipulative influence goesmeanwhile the scene culminates in a crucial revelation the realization that feyd rautha has the potential to be a candidate for the kwisatz haderach this revelation was brought to light by his successful passage of the gom jabbar test additionally lady fenring being impregnated by feyd and following the revernd mothers explicit instructions to ensure that the baby was a girl ensures the continuation of the harkonnen lineage as they the bene gesserit desire thus solidifying the bene gesserits influence behind,positive
873,it was an epic experience and every scene was crafted to perfection i hope that dune will be nominated for the oscars the film is suspenseful coherent and intriguing at the same time an interesting phenomenon was how the main character gained selfconfidence during the session the love story was also developed im glad that zandya won much more than in the first part because i love this girl she is incredibly talented and incredibly beautiful even in the years of the desert rat i cannot forget about the colors of the film in which it was recorded it was perfectly matched and reflected the desert atmosphere of the film,positive
874,woawww just woawwwjust saw dune part last night and omg its amazingto be honest this movie was better than the first movie the cinematography the acting action the music was fantasticits been a long time i saw such a masterpiece in theaters the movie has way more action and is darker than the first movie everyone does a great job i saw this in a dolby cinema and there is a scene in this movie with a sandworm and im telling you my whole chair was shaking it was trilling and austin butler as fayd reuther was great a new cinematic legend is born i cant wait to see more of himi cant wait to see dune part,positive
875,the plot the imagery the characters the emotions the scenery and everything was theres a scene were timothee is heavily breathing and groaning and its embedded in my mind i will be saving that in my head for certain activities the way his character develops throughout this movie is gorgeous he needs an oscar and medal for this jesusaustin butler was fascinating to watch his voice his expressions his cruelty in this movie is mindbogglingzendaya slayed as usual shes perfect and the way she showed channis emotions was breathtakingi want this whole movie tattooed into my brain forever and ever,positive
876,this movie has restored my faith in the cinema admittedly i am a huge fan of the books and so i was already sold on this but so often these days we see many franchises being brought to the big screen and totally disregarding the fan base to try and appeal to nonexistent alternative audience i am so pleased that the source material is respected and no character is compromised by any lazy script writing or misunderstanding of character arcsthe cinematography is incredible with a real feel of a large scale desert planet and the battle scenes that feel like they have been pulled directly from frank herberts mind with an emphasis on close combat sword fights in a scifi settingthe acting from timmy zendaya rebecca ferguson and austin butler is fantastic and should be recognised has topclass in fact i do not think you could find anyone better than timothee to play paul atreides the role was made for himdune part retrospectively makes dune part even better than it already was,positive
877,i loved villeneuves blade runner but i found his dune parts and extremely difficult to enjoy despite the impressive photography the main issue for me lies in the lack of a relatable protagonist timothe chalamets acting is great but he is not charismatic in the role of paul this affects the way we the audience are unable to empathise with the protagonist and his narrative arc the only character in villeneuves take on dune i liked was jason momoas incarnation of duncan in part like many others i wanted to like this but i could not this prompted me to rewatch lynchs dune a masterpiece in disarray quoting the title of m evrys excellent book a film broken during editing and postproduction by universal and de laurentiis in spite of its many flaws the theatrical cut has so much vision a unique vibe and a spectacular soundtrack that makes for a much more enjoyable watchif we could have access to the original hour cut as intended by lynch what a gift to mankind that would be,positive
878,i loved this movie i only recently watched dune part a few months ago and was so taken away by it and so regretful for not watching it in theatres to get the full experience i had high expectations and it exceeded the pacing in the nd half did feel a little rushed compared to the first half but this was such a beautiful movie all around this has been the only movie that i am and will pay a full price ticket for to watch again and again in theatres down to the acting visuals writing score special effects sound effects etcit hits all the marks for mespecial shout out to javier bardem for making me crack up with his character lisan al gaib all of the cast was phenomenali am sure this movie will win tons of well deserved awards,positive
879,i loved part but expected more from this movie while it maintains the excellent atmosphere and almost everyone does a fine job acting there are a few inexplicable story changes that hurt this movieno navigators really the reason dune is the most important planet in the universe and you cant be bothered to put them in the movie not coolno weirding training this is the main thing that makes paul so important to the fremen and its completely left out whychani dumps paul wtf this is exactly the opposite of the book how are they going to have the leto boys be born for part with this nonsensezendaya she alternates between looking unreasonably angry and way too goofy seriously why does she get roles also this is the second character she has robbed of red hair mj being the first uneffingforgivablei wanted to like this more and maybe i will after watching it again but it just missed the mark for absence of navigators for weirding training omission for chani turning on paul for miscasting chanifinal grade,positive
880,i dont believe iti dont believe that the rating for this movie is that highhowthis movie is ok not great but ok and i refuse to believe that the amount of s are authenticthe battle scenes make little sense why are so many people using swords when they can and do just shoot each otherthe harkonen make storm troopers from star wars look like master fighters as do the feared sardukar they are often just brushed aside and no challenge whatsoeverchani is unlikeable towards the end of the film as is paulthe baron and most of his family are defeated super easily as is the emperor who was cast poorlyhow were these clowns in power for so long the only good fight they put up is one paul needs to invite rather than be subjected tothe movie spent too long on certain parts and rushed the endit was a disappointing ok moviewe are living in a world of makebelieve if this is a masterpiece,positive
881,dune part is an exceptional film that delivers on all fronts with stunning performances adrenalinepumping action sequences and immersive worldbuilding it captivates audiences from start to finish the casts chemistry and talent shine through elevating the storytelling to new heights denis villeneuve masterfully crafts a thrilling cinematic experience that leaves a lasting impact whether youre a fan of the books or not dune part is a mustwatch that will leave you wanting morethe cinematography in dune part is truly mindblowing enhancing the films visual appeal and immersive experience while the movie deviates significantly from the second part of the book it does so for the better adapting a challenging book is no easy feat yet the film succeeds in making it accessible to a wider audience by infusing it with more action this departure from the source material does not negatively affect the film but the more actionpacked ending ultimately enriches the viewing experience making it a thrilling ride for both fans of the book and newcomers alike,positive
882,i watched this in imax and it was sensationel all i was worried i had too high expectations for the movie but still i was completely blown away everything is perfect the acting the sounds the music the character development in part is insanely good i liked all the movie but the end was the best part for me the raised flags of atreides the final fight the silence loved it all the casting is also perfect and you could feel the improvement of the characters in part i think it was the first time i was in a cinema and everyone started clapping at the end the cinema was completely sold out great stuff guys keep it coming,positive
883,truly epic film reminds you of why we love the movies and the movie theater not since the first dune have a seen a film so big it reminds you of old hollywood and the movie events it used to produce find the biggest theatre with the best sound quality and enjoy an amazing experience the books are very complex but denis translated it to the screen brilliantly hans zimmerman delivered again with a soundtrack you feel in your bones every actor brought their a game and brought you into the story deserves a third installment to keep the story going already reserved tickets to go back next weekend and see it again,positive
884,this film is very goodwe need it to improve the hollywood cinema in the top of cinema the first half of dune part two is among the best things that villeneuve has ever done though the sheer eventfulness of the plot and a bustling retinue of sideplayers austin butler upgrading stings codpieced ninny from the film into a hairless psychopath is worthy of mention means that the final act does feel rusheddune part two is certainly up there with some of the best science fiction movies ive ever seenvilleneuves facility with this stuff doesnt just come from his talent for spectacle though there are set pieces in dune part two that aim to blow the top of your skull off,positive
885,finally a necessary sequel that surpasses the original on a huge scalea masterclass in filmmaking by denis villeneuve who effortlessly brings the complex universe of dune to life the storytelling is a brilliant tapestry of intrigue seamlessly blending intricate plotlines and character arcsthe cinematography is a visual feast with beautiful desert landscapes that transport the audience to arrakis itself the ensemble cast led by timothee chalamet and zendaya breathes life into each character creating a captivating onscreen chemistryfurthermore the music score composed by hans zimmer elevates the entire experience perfectly complimenting the grandeur of the narrativedune part is a cinematic triumph a symphony of talent converging to deliver a truly unforgettable masterpiece of cinema history,positive
886,lets start with the good the imagery is absolutely stunningthe desert views the world the fremens the harkonens wowthe worm riding scene is particularly impressive the combination of action visuals and sound is visceralthe sound for those not so few like myself who thought the academy mistakenly awarded the oscar instead of the razzie for the sound of dune good news villeneuve reigns in the noise and does a pretty good job with it this timeno longer a distraction the soundtrack builds and blends with the scenery masterfully thats how its done deniswell enough with the goodthe character development aside from paul and chani is altogether lacking jessica and stilgar get some screen time just to give the barest support the origin storyline the harkonnens though rendered beautifully are not just unidimensional vileneuve practically comes out and spells unidimensional in black and white letters yes theyre brutes we get itthe storyline is pretty much a mediocre love story its nice not terrible but its just that as a stand alone it is an enjoyable enough watch but thats about itvilleneuve puts very little effort into exploring the complexity of the dune world and that of kwisatz haderachand here comes the missed opportunitiesthe original dune is by some measure the origin story of being with the power to bring space and time together a superhuman a demigod a story of intrigue and plotting and plans within plans within plansbut villeneuves is a lackluster story of a a sort of fortune teller conning a few fundamentalists into following himthere is no awe aside from that inspired by the visuals and as result there is no way to properly end this storyunable to lean on the cgi and unsupported by the underdeveloped story line the final falls flati remember your gom jabbar you remember mine i can kill you with one word paul should have said words that could have sent a shiver down the viewers spinebut perhaps villeneuve chose the pathetic silence to avoid the viewers puzzled looks remembert the what whats bene gesserit anywayin summary this is not a masterpiece but its a decent movie with great visuals better than the st one thats for sureit could have been far better if villeneuve managed to explore paul becoming the kwisatz haderach,positive
887,one of the best movies of the decade im talking empire strikes back level great fantastic writing acting worldbuilding dialogue action sequences cinematography production design and more its also thematically rich and features nuanced and multilayered complex characters even in the first minutes i knew it would be even better than the first the first is still amazing btwthe score is flawless and the sound design is unique and exquisite i really dont have any issues with this movie i guess my only minor qualm would be that we barely got any screentime with florence pughs and christopher walkkens characters and it couldve been pretty cool if we dived into their politics and storyline a tad more anyhow im sure we will see it more in dune messiah fingers crossed it happens highly recommend probably will be my favourite movie of the year,positive
888,i found the film entertaining but was disappointed at the lack of acting what is the purpose of having a renowned character actor like christopher walken who can captivate his audience with his oratory performances and not giving him lines to recite most of the actresss faces are hidden behind face veils making it almost impossible to see who is really doing the acting when we do see their faces we can see nose eyes and mouth and they are covered by a veil which only allows a shadow of the persons face viewable to the audience the movie goes to great lengths to deglamorize the physical beauty of a mature female by covering up all defining physical attributes with outer wear that is similar to middle eastern desert dress the fighting scenes tend to be bloodless in fact almost all the blood is replace with water or blue stuff it seems this film went to the extremes to comply with the pg rating why the strange thing about the film is how it relates to religious fanatics and war and in the end we have a holy war why seems the whole fuss was about the blue stuff and nothing to do with religion except for the fact that the blue stuffs home planet is populated by a very religious majority the root cause from all the fighting is the pursuit of power and wealth that comes from controlling the blue stuff so why not just tell the story from the point of view of a greed and power struggle and give the actors some decent line to recite not covering up the females and their physical beauty show some blood in the fighting and maybe some intimate love making might help bottom line is that you can only look at a sea of sand for so long and three hours is way over my limit,positive
889,this movie has received a tremendous amount of praise and hype i was really looking forward to it because i thoroughly enjoyed the first installment while dune is visually stunning in my opinion the film is no masterpiece certainly not on par with sequels like the empire strikes back or the two towers there were fun moments for sure but to me the overall story arc the pacing the character development most of it fell flat there was really no character i could care about or root for the score by the great hans zimmer was forgettable and the casting of christopher walken as the emperor was a mistake i came away disappointed,positive
890,ill start by saying that its been a long time since a movie left me breathless like this such exquisite work such delicacy and dedication could only result in a film that will leave its mark for a long long time as soon as the movie ends its hard to decide whether i want to watch it all over again or if i need a sequel dune is a beautiful example that hard work and talent always pay off i find it difficult to write about what i liked because im still ecstatic about what i saw the character development works very well especially with paul and his mothers arc the meticulously crafted art direction and photography the sound design aimed at deeper immersion the choreography of the fights is excellent but what truly captivates us is the perfect work of director denis villeneuve who unsurprisingly hits the mark once again a simply incredible film and worth every second,positive
891,a great movie to see at the theater this gigantic visual spectacle features some characters you know from the first film and some interesting new ones including christopher walken it is visually stunning dark complex and draws from great cinema and deep historical references of the past of human history we saw it in imax which is well worth it this film is definitely want to see in the theater and you should not wait to watch on a television you will only get about half the effect on a tv screen that said the film was a bit long and despite a few slow moments it kept us fully engaged and felt and thrallingly real despite its otherworldly characters and planets truly an inspiring piece of cinema the captures both the human spirit the conflict of humanity the flaws of emotion and the goodness of the human spirit great cinematic classic,positive
892,this is simply one of the best movies made of all time and for numerous reasonsthe sound and music enhance the visuals as much as d and continue in the same vein from the arabesque singing from the firemen to the throaty rattles of the bad guys bonus points awarded for actually making the talking levels of suitable standard for humans no mumbling dialogue anywherehow do you make sand look so stunning at times like an ocean vista calm and sprawling others a sea in full anger and rage never dull imageryim not a fan of films too long but this absolutely flew by no gaps no fillers just a story motoring along at a pace that brings you with it without any confusionthe characters develop steadily in tangent with the story i cant find any fault,positive
893,i have never written any reviews for a movie ever but i must say dune part was the best movie i had the pleasure to watch in cinema it was like they premiered the movie before and collected all the critics and mistakes they have done and then they remade the movie its that good the acting music fight scenes cinematography the world building and the characters were well thoughteverything was on point i really dont know if they can top this with part and if they do this would be the best trilogy of all time to anyone who wants to wait to watch it in their homes just dont this movie is crafted for imax this is indeed peak cinema,positive
894,spellar and spectacular the film grabs you from start to finish chalamet is at the top of his game giving his most impressive performance he is the perfect paul atreides villeneuve really nailed it the culmination it produces with part is science at his peak i was on board with every changes and every departure of the book its the perfect adaptation and cinema at its purest zendaya rebecca ferguson florence pugh charlotte rampling and javier bardem are an incredible supporting ensemble and shines bright its up there with the two tower from jackson the empire strikes back from george lucas that it somehow exceeds even hans zimmer will receive the oscar no doubt this will make a razzia at the next academy award in for sure,positive
895,visually stuning a true masterpieceanyone rating this movie anything under needs to be admittedthe movie was almost hours long but i didnt want it to end absolutly brillant the acting the storylinei remember dune being one of my favorite movie as a kid and then discovering the books after and then the video games this movie honors them all and its so rare for a movie to honor the books it was based ofthe soundtrack like the part is a masterpiecei never wrote a review on here before but my goodness i left the theater feeling like my life was empty now i need to see it againi sure hope they will release an extended cut,positive
896,a beautifully directed film that suffers from a lot of boring and mumbled dialogue part one was a great film almost perfect it did all the heavy lifting of setting the scene and world building that should have allowed part two to just get on with things however we spend the first hour of this film explaining to the audience what is going on and even then its baffling to most who havent read the booksthe acting is great throughout and the cinematography is some of the best youll ever see as you would expect from denis but it just doesnt make up for the pacing and dialogue which fall short in this one,positive
897,describing a movie as flawless might seem foolish yet for dune part two such a claim is apt simply put this film embodies flawlessnessdune embodies the essence of every scifi epic and beyond it sets the standard every movie should aspire to reach for i in awe endured minutes as did the entire theater captivated by its sheer brilliancedenis villeneuve is truly passionate about his work and it shines through on screen he ensures that every detail from cinematography to choreography is crafted with an extraordinary level of care and attentionthroughout its riveting minute runtime i was never once distracted it only grew more captivating with each passing moment and oh that second half it was quite simply the most astonishing thing ive witnessed in yearsevery member of the cast delivered stellar performances contributing to the films excellence special commendation goes to austin butler stellan skarsgrd josh brolin and javier bardem for their outstanding contributions which in my view elevated the movie to new heights of cinematic achievementdune boasts aweinspiring makeup costumes art direction and performances that dare to redefine cinematic excellence as we eagerly anticipate dune part two its clear this saga will boldly etch its legacy as a fearless masterpiece thanks in no small part to the daring vision of greig fraserwhile its still in theaters catch it on imax trust me its an experience you wont soon forget the cinematic event of the decade,positive
898,the first movie was visually stunning but boring as hell so basically the second one was marketed as a masterpiece best scifi movie ever by critics and even compared to best star wars moviesis it a masterpiece or did we watch the same story before in many forms matrix maybe prophecies chosen ones and dreams offer same type of premisesaustin butlers villian portrayal is nowhere close to ledgers joker or bardems chigurh but still pred agressively as so chalamet is a big ok as protagonist zendaya is the weakest part actingwise and her california accent doesnt help the spice planet villeneuves directing is maybe flawless but still relies way too much on visual and sound zimmers soundtrack is intense and original as always lifting up scenes one levelthe only difference between dune and rebel moon are a better director and fat studio budget in real is it good yes it is but a at max nothing more,positive
899,paul would not have lowered himself by saying you die like a pig to the baron he now stabs in the throat like a barbarian miserable faithlessness to herberts vision and pandering to the tragic zeitgeist of retribution we are experiencing in societythis was a disappointment to watch the film and to forgive diversions here and there but this act fully changes the substance of what paul is made ofno better than a harkonnenthe imagery is colossal imposing threatening this part is welldone a shiny set distracts from the flaws of its actors and the storyline im not saying the movie is a waste but dont expect it to be faithful to the novel for those of us left that read,negative
900,i do not want to overhype the movie i loved part one so much however i think that part two is even better than part one the cinematography is obviously as incredible or better than part one but somehow even the character development the plot and the action are all incredible too this movie is more intense and the stakes feel much higherthe soundtrack perfectly complements the visuals leaving you entranced and in awe throughout the movie the incredible imagery shines through the rise to power throughout the movie gives off a sense of power and an exuberant sense of overwhelming strengthoverall i suggest watching this movie if you havent seen part one i would watch part one first,positive
901,i was about through the movie when it just hit me am i watching the best movie of all time or am i crazyglad im not the only one who is in love with this film best movie of all time maybe best scifi of all time easy yesit even had great comical relief rarely seen in these kinds of films done well the action scenes had me on the edge of my seat unlike any film i have ever watched the freaking movie even had an unbelievably interesting war strategy aspect to it when this movie pops off it really pops off my mouth was wide open multiple timesthe costume designs are truly amazing the team behind this film is absolutely talented,positive
902,for a hour film my first thought was gunna be that its filled with filler content to make up the time but i really wasnt the whole film was gripping and well built sometimes the story felt hard to follow with the skips and jumps with is my only reason for this not being a however it is still an amazing watch and defiantly one i would recommend to anyone after being a little disappointed by the first one with it feeling to be quite slow paced and jagged this has changed my mind considerably with the series and the ending gives a great opportunity to a third which of course was obvious with how much of the story still hasnt been told from the books great watch length really wasnt an issue,positive
903,quite possibly the easiest rating i will have to give to any movie that comes out this year not only is dune part better than its predecessor it is better than any sifi movie in the last years with the narrow and arguable exception to interstellar if this does not speak to the magnitude of dune part then i dont know what does because for a sifi action film this is as good as it gets almost perfect with nothing i would change as the viewer some ideas of this would be the actors the use of visual affects and cgi in certain areas of the film and even the casting was unarguablefirst of all i would like to shed light on austin butler because not only was he incredible and honestly a surprise he was absolutely terrifying this guy made any starwars villain look like a stuffed animal if only dune part came out a few months earlier because austin butler would have for sure been a front runner for best supporting actor because he was just breath taking and defiantly a star in a bright roomwith austin butler being my stand out actor i still have to mention timothee chalamet because again he was unbelievable on the same level as austin butler contrary to my earlier comments what makes me believe this is the passion and anger in his voice was just bone chilling and almost any scene where he was ready to make a decision sent shivers down my spine because all of the plot was falling into place but it was just amplified that much more with incredible actingnow with my actors concluded i must talk about the cgi and visual affects because dune part would be little without them all i can say is wow the visual affects made starwars and avatar look cheap and that is saying something considering it had nowhere near as much funding and budget i mean even the scenes with the sand worms where perfect and could not look any more realistic but i cant leave it there because it doesnt stop there the space ship although other worldly still looked like they where one hundred percent real dune part really was a stunning spectacle for the eyesand for the best part of dune part the cinematography was some of the best you will ever see in your life and i mean it no movie of film ever comes remotely near especially in the sifi genre which speaks to how incredible dune part is even the black and white shots looked stunning and sharper than a knife no matter what you end up watching this on it will still look beautiful one scene in particular that stood out which was when timothee chalamet and austin butler where fighting and the camara was set horizontally perpendicular to where they where fighting and the sun was symmetrical to the middle of the screen and the glare of the sun broke out into the audience in short because i could talk about this one scene for hours it was one of the greatest and most captivating scenes in any movie in history truly amazing there is so much more to cover with the cinematography but i dont have space or time but honestly you could watch dune part just for the cinematography and you would be impressedit doesnt matter if you believe in the prophesy or not because one thing i can say is that dune part is a special movie and one that does not come by very often so it needs to be appreciated because there are so many factors that make this a perfect film on its own and a perfect sequel because facing facts it is better than dune part but it is also better than any other movie you will go and see this year what i am trying to say is that it will take something very special to top dune part and with that i cannot wait for part because i am sure they will do an even better job than what has already been done goodbye and go and watch dune part i implore you an easy out of,positive
904,absolutely stunning film and story this is film making at its best this is where hollywood should be not trying to brainwash audiences but just telling amazing stories with brilliant performances from all the actors from edge of your seat fight scenes with brilliant choreography to passion you cant feel between characters and of course bringing drama and emotion excellent work by hanz zimmer on the sound trackdisney take notes this is the expectations the people have of genre like star wars change your direction remake and remould what you have messed up but do not presume you will make money by buying up brands and twisting it to be an agenda you will lose again to classics like dune,positive
905,when we think of a cinematic experience this movie is exactly what i think we mean its exactly the sort of filmmaking that cinemas are made for from set design to special effects fight choreography wardrobe cinematography direction acting screenwriting you name it and this film delivers an awe have been so oversaturated with bland uninspired and creatively bankrupt films over the last number of years that going to the cinema has lost much of the excitement that used to surround a trip to the movies the confidence we used to have that studios and directors were going to at least attempt to deliver to us creatively rich films that engaged us as audience in more ways than simple entertainment is all but gone but dune part two is a return to such films and hopefully a reminder to the rest of hollywood that this is not only what we desire to see at the movies but what we expectfrom my perspective a film moves from entertainment to art when it causes you to reflect on its story themes and the world it invites you to participate in beyond its runtime when you find yourself reflecting on a film hours and even days after youve seen it then its possible youve viewed a work of art director denis villenueve has done that made a work of artcome for the sandworms the scifi action and stunning visuals of the world of dune stay for a beautifully told human story of power and who we are willing to be in order to attain it and even more profoundly who we inevitably become once we have it,positive
906,i am so disappointed maybe the hype got to me i loved part this is a good film but i found it lacking something was missing and it is difficult to put a finger on what that isthe editing was jarring and disruptive for some reason scenes did not flow into another i felt as the viewer as though i was kept at a distance but that was probably the point the timing was off and the film kept jumping too quickly from scene to scene i am a fan of the book and had if it had not been for that i may have given up on the film half way throughthe costumes were good but did not make such an impression on me as part didoverall a good film but it did not live up to expectations,positive
907,dune part two is a thrilling film that offers sensory and imaginative immersion it features a lone figure atop a worm a man trapped by a psychic seduction and gladiatorial combat on an inhospitable planet the film is a testament to denis villeneuves gamble in adapting half of frank herberts foundational scifi novel with no guarantee of a sequel the films audacious moments and inhospitable environment make it a mustwatch for fans of the genre in the book dune messiah the idea of heroic destiny is exposed as a lie created by others for colonization and control paul atreides a fremen warrior arrives on the desert planet of arrakis only to discover he is the product of generations of genetic manipulation by his mother lady jessica and her bene gesserit clan their work spreads whispers of a prophet the lisan algaib leading the indigenous fremen people towards freedom the house of atreides falls and paul and lady jessica seek sanctuary and acceptance with a fremen tribe princess irulan daughter of the padishah emperor worries about her fathers inaction herbert wrote the sequel dune messiah partly in response to those who believed they had failed to grasp the sinister implications of pauls ascendancy villeneuve has expressed his ambition to turn messiah into a third film but it is no guarantee the final third of part two emanates pure menace unlike any other blockbuster in existence chalamet and fergusons performances in the film are criticized for being overly regal and dignified chani plays a crucial role as the moral center zendaya with clarity and resolution stellan skarsgrds baron harkonnen returns and his nephew and heir feydrautha is introduced by austin butler butlers uncanny skarsgrd impersonation makes the audience question whether his sons alexander gustaf bill and valter are about to be replaced butlers portrayal of sting in metal underpants and his entire body is a testament to his talent and dedication villeneuves film part two honors the books middle eastern and north african influences by incorporating josh brolins performance as pauls mentor gurney halleck and the use of hr gigerinspired machines the film is both grand and intimate with hans zimmers score and theatre seats rumbling with every cresting sand worm however its crucial not to treat dunes creative triumphs as a blanket absolution the arabicinspired language of the book is now foregrounded and onscreen representation is slightly improved with tunisian actor souheila yacoub playing shishakli chanis closest ally,positive
908,ok this was very well made acted and filmed and i enjoyed it even though like many other viewers i knew the story having seen other versions that were made the acting was good the effects were excellent and the design of the buildings flying machines etc were really imaginativebut why so many dark interior scenes didnt they invent a light bulb in that future world so many scenes where i was squinting to see who was who and what they were doing why spend millions making an excellent movie and then hide everything in darkness and shadow maybe it sounds petty but it spoiled the movie for me i guess the director didnt want to make a shiny cute star wars kind of future world and i get that but i really felt disappointed that so much was hidden from view just to create a mood or atmosphere,positive
909,i like many others wanted this to be as good if not better than the first sadly it lacked in every single department from acting editing story telling and most importantly directionif your didnt know the story you would be completely lost jumping from one thing to another without any explanation the original dune still gives me chills all this succeeded in doing is giving me the horrors and not in a good way to divert slightly from the original story is the prerogative of any director but to completely ignore it was a touch of insanity and an insult to the original storyabsolutely nothing in this film made me fall in love or even root for one single character in this film there was no passion no magic there is more drama in paw patrolwaste your time if you must remember you cant get it back it is to precious to waste on such complete tripe,positive
910,costumes and makeup were absolutely stellar i believed every moment of it florence pugh was fantastic as always and zendaya showed capability that i did not earnestly expect but above all timothe was incredibly captivating every time he was on the screen i highly recommend to experience this film in imax as it provides an exemplary showcase of the enormous scale in which the events in the movie transpire dune part is a perfect example of why audiences attend theatres and what it truly means to provide entertainment to a captivated audience i am very excited to see what is next for this cast and director thank you,positive
911,dune part takes audiences on a spellbinding odyssey across the majestic sands of arrakis weaving a tapestry of breathtaking visuals and intricate storytelling reminiscent of the complexity found in indian politics as the sequel to the highly acclaimed dune this installment promises an even deeper immersion into the rich universe created by frank herbert where alliances are fragile and power is the ultimate currencyfrom the opening scenes viewers are thrust into a world where every grain of sand holds a secret and every character harbors ambitions that could reshape the fate of entire civilizations director denis villeneuve masterfully balances the grandeur of the landscape with the intimate struggles of its inhabitants creating a cinematic experience that is as mesmerizing as it is thoughtprovokingat the heart of dune part lies a plot as intricate as the labyrinthine corridors of political power in india like a masterful chess game played on a cosmic scale the narrative unfolds with a series of unexpected twists and turns keeping audiences on the edge of their seats until the very end much like a bollywood masala film the story is rich with drama intrigue and largerthanlife characters whose destinies are intertwined in ways both profound and unforeseenyet amidst the political machinations and intergalactic power struggles dune part introduces an unlikely hero the sandworms of arrakis previously viewed as mere beasts of burden these colossal creatures emerge as symbols of resilience and defiance challenging the established order and reshaping the very fabric of indian cinema their presence adds a layer of myth and mystique to an already captivating narrative serving as a reminder that true heroism often comes from the unlikeliest of placeswhat sets dune part apart from other scifi epics is its ability to transcend the boundaries of genre and resonate with audiences on a deeply human level amidst the spectacle of interstellar warfare and cosmic intrigue the film explores themes of identity destiny and the enduring struggle for freedom it is a testament to the power of storytelling to illuminate the human condition and inspire audiences to ponder the deeper questions of existenceas the credits roll and the echoes of the final battle fade into the ether one cannot help but feel a sense of longing for more like a plate of piping hot samosas on a rainy day dune part leaves audiences craving for another taste of its intoxicating blend of action suspense and spectacle it is a testament to the enduring appeal of cinema to transport us to worlds beyond our imagination and leave us forever changed by the experience,positive
912,a worthy squeal as with part the cinematography was excellent the use of scale and angles was a pleasure to the eye if you are familiar with the novels you will see they are moving the story along well with a little tweaking here and therei love christopher walken but not sure he needed to be in this filmthe music is as grand as the scenery and i was not disappointed at all with the worm riding you could almost feel how hard it must be to do great directing and special effects and the actors and actresses made you feel with them as good performers shouldlooking forward to the rd,positive
913,it was a pleasure to watch this movie on opening day visually stunning it ranks among the greatest scifi film of the decade in my opinion having read the book im impressed by denis villeneuves masterful adaptation and his captivating vision of this universe and world building his cinematography beautifully portrays pauls journey and destiny the story builds expertly on part one with strong characters facing difficult choices i once again praise greg frazier for the breathtaking images the sound design team and everyone involved in the incredible sets and costume design i cant wait for dune messiah and highly recommend everyone to experience this film in the theaters,positive
914,the book builds a very large and complicated world even by science fiction standards so to even dare to create a film version of it was ambitious from day one there are so many ways it could go wrong and so many risks part one worked at least for me i was apprehensive about part two as i feared it might let me down or become bogged down in the vast details of the novel or be yet another victim of filmmaking by committee so that everything lost its colour and strangeness that did not happen this is a special film its an intelligent beautifully made blockbuster its an act of devotion for the novels toodune part two is a long thoughtprovoking and ambitious film that sets out as a philosophical study of the nature of belief and religion and manages to be that without losing any of the spectacular visual beauty and drama along the way it isnt a particularly light or easy film but it is stunning and it asks you to pay attention to it fully its a serious film i respect that because its a serious book with a serious point to makethe landscapes are striking and strange there are thrilling and tense moments there are also softer moments of intimacy and strong characterisation i think lady jessica particularly comes across as extraordinarily dangerous manipulative and without any other options except to be that paul is the reluctant messiah who understands that nothing actually compels him to do what the prophecies say but that at the same time he will do what the prophecies say because there is no other way out his struggles are very well represented and easy to understand without being oversimplifiedwhat i did not like the reason its a rather than a was that a couple of moments were a little unnaturally segued into in my opinion things seemed to be rather sudden developments on occasion i also think the ending was good in that it wasnt an ending but just a beginning of a new phase of the story which fits with the novels and pauls situation but it might have left some people rather unsatisfied,positive
915,this movie is something really special of course it is a strange journey on strange planets but there is so much humanity and exestentialism involved it becomes a very universal storythis story the score and the cinemateography is pure poetry from beginning to end denis villeneuve stepped up his craft in a major way exceeding already enormous expextations and creating images no one has ever seen it is a landmark in movie making that has to be experienced in a cinemathe cast gives amazing performances but timothe chalamet zendaya and austin butler are the stand outs of the movie,positive
916,the movie we waited for and been hyped for did not disappoint when it comes to cinematography visually it makes you live in the dune universe and then once youre in it you wait for the plot to build up which they tried doing but never really even scratched the full potential of the characters or the abilities of this brilliant cast the conversations were choppy the emotions were shallow the viewer couldnt really connect to any of the characters emotions or journey let alone those of paul me as a viewer couldnt emotionally attach to chani pauls love it was only introduced briefly here and there while we are actually being focused on pauls emotional growthdevelopment journey also with such a heavy press tour the background that was given to the viewer that zendaya timothy are best friend in real life it was even harder to feel their on screen chemistry,positive
917,this was epic the sounds music graphics decor acting scnery costumes it was mesmerizing from start til end some parts were terrifying in their perfect settings the wormriding is one of the most intense and thrilling scenes i have ever watched and i am a big horror fanthe atmosphere reminded me of the cell at least in terms of cinematography absolutely beautifull and the wait for the last part of the triology which release will be in at his best will be sweet torture and please let austin butler become a bold goth god he is sexy as hell in this masterpiece i am prettig sure i will watch it over and over untill part three is there anyway,positive
918,i really liked the movie and now you are probably asking why i have given it a visually i think this should be the hollywood standard for every big blockbuster movie i belevie everything i saw was for real escpecially the scene where paul rides the sand worm that scene was beuatifully donenow for the rest of the movie the dialog at times where really akward escpecially in some fight scenes where characters just stopped the fight to stare and say single word or sometimes nothing at all just akward silence at first i didnt really notice it but when this pattern repeated it self it got to mealso i thought the movie was overconfusing sometimes where the main character paul would be called like different names in some prophercy so it was hard to keep track at times who they were talking aboutso to sum it all up i wasnt too keen on the first dune film but thought it was a pleasnt surprice though it lacked a bit of action this had a lot of action wich i liked but akward dialog and over complicated prophercys dragged this down a little but over all a visually pleasing good movie would recommend it to anyone,positive
919,the first three quarters of the movie were a close enough interpretation of the source material to be acceptable and entertaining the forced love story between paul and chani however veered too far away from the book in an attempt to create a tragic romance for the sake of a hollywood ending and ultimately ruined the moviespoilers for those who havent read the book the romance between paul and chani sounding like johnny when timothe chalamet says it is not a source of tension the falsely created subplot in which chani declares paul a false prophet and the overall sourfaced disgruntled demeanor that zendaya portrays during the last quarter of the movie are fabrications by denis villeneuve the bigger question is does this enhance or take away from the overall story absolutely without a doubt this detracts from the story because it shifts focus from the central nemesis of the film while simultaneously failing in an attempt to create a love story that the audience cares aboutto cap it off the final closeup on chani emitting a pouty quivering chin is a failed attempt to evoke heartbreak we should care aboutdenis was trying way too hard to create the trinityneo romance and somehow force it into his version of dune which up until this point did a superb job of sticking to the pages of the book dune part one excellent dune part two ruined by a flat forced zerochemistry poorly executed madeforthemovie heartbreak story or perhaps its simply a poor performance by zendaya who came across as far too unlikable ive talked to others who didnt read the book and felt the same way either way its a miss,positive
920,its rare to feel this engaged watching a movie these days this is old school cinema like dances with wolves or lawrence of arabia lengthy movies that never get boring and leave you on the edge of your seat and a sense of awe im a biiiig fan of dune i loved the lynch movie read all the books and even watched the equally terrible and underrated scifi series but this movie dune and dune part brought what i imagened in my head all these years to life kudos to the casting all incredible and absolutely perfect although javier bardem and austin butler clearly stole the show in this second part now i just hope they keep going the story is far from over enjoy and watch it in imax if possible,positive
921,the plot the cast the visuals the sounds music everything was in a word epicafter watching the first movie i wasnt expecting a lot from the second one but im glad i was proven wrong you can tell the budget was high and they really spent every last cent on making this the highest quality possible it really makes you dive into that world and experience it as if its a real thing the acting was very convincing especially the chemistry between timothe and zendaya and paired with amazing sound effects in certain scenes really satisfyingif you plan on watching this movie make sure to watch it in a cinema for the best experience it will be worth it,positive
922,itd not often ill sit a write up a movie review but after just experiencing this masterpiece in imax i felt like i just had tothis part could not have been done better the score fights worms heroism and just sheer intensity had me gripped from start to finish on every level its a set of cinematic genius the craft is expertly made and it shows in every shot every note of the score and every scene that transports the audience to arrakisreally loved the character development between paul and chani as wella great addition is austin butler as the barons sociopathic hypervicious nephew he did look in awe of the muaddib powers as it was written,positive
923,a cinematic masterpiece dune is spectacular in every way from the world building to the character development everything was perfect just as i had imagined it when i read the books every actor brought their agame and although i wasnt overly fond of timothee as paul in dune he did an amazing job this time austin butler as feydrautha was even more menacing than in the books even for people who have not read the series denis explained as much as he could without taking away from the film especially bene gesserit customs praise to denis for his homage to the world of frank herbert a monumental achievement long live the fighters,positive
924,its rare that i walk out of the theatre more excited about a film than i was going in especially when my anticipation was already so high but villeneuve and his crew absolutely pulled it off again with this mesmerising masterpiece that pulled me down to the surface of arrakis and pushed me through a religious revolution without ever letting gothats not to deny its flaws its probably a bit too long some characters are turned into a caricature of themselves some deviations from the book were clearly done for brevity but others are serious deviations that will surely have major ramifications as the story continues it hits a little too hard on the nose with its core message that religion is a great power but morally ambiguousall of that is nitpicking however the film manages to combine multiple plot lines character development and world building without sacrificing pace or relying on fight scenes to keep the momentum going its true to the broad strokes and some of the smaller ones of frank herberts vision but perfectly accessible to someone who only saw part one years ago every piece of the film making craft comes together in this beautiful scifi epic for once the cliche that watching a film in a cinema with the largest screen you can get to is an experience rings true,positive
925,the film ends in a different way compared to the book frank herbert didnt want to portray paul as a hero but the antihero and thats exactly what this film does with the altered end paul simply goes too farthere are bits which are rushed but in general it has a nice pacing the characters are believable the actors are very good and theres not a single moment in this film that made me feel bored or tired its an engaging experience from beginning to endthe way the story is laid out also doesnt patronise the viewer and doesnt dumb down the plot which i liketheres no woke agenda here no inclusivity pandering no mischaracterised masculinity no politics besides the one thats part of the dune universe its a plain good oldfashioned science fiction story with a healthy dose of dramabest film ive seen this year and one of the best ive seen in many years,positive
926,there were great elements here but they really needed someone in charge to tie it up into a nice hour and a half long package it felt like way too much extra footage left in scattered all throughout the middle and midend and im frustrated thinking about how much of a punch this movie could have packed if it were properly edited to do so still great cinematography and sound design and some intense moments in the first hour and last half hour or so it would be hard to bring myself to go through a rewatch for these moments given that id have to sit through all the rest so this will probably wind up being a movie i forget about,positive
927,dune crafted by the visionary denis villeneuve is nothing short of a cinematic marvel building upon the foundation laid by its predecessor this epic scifi saga transports audiences to a breathtaking universe filled with rich lore stunning visuals and unforgettable performances villeneuves masterful direction ensures every frame is meticulously crafted immersing viewers in the intricate world of arrakis and its compelling characters the stellar cast led by timothe chalamet and zendaya delivers powerhouse performances that breathe life into frank herberts iconic characters from its sweeping desert landscapes to its aweinspiring set designs every aspect of dune is a testament to villeneuves unparalleled talent and dedication to his craft with its gripping storytelling breathtaking visuals and immersive worldbuilding dune cements itself as a modern scifi masterpiece that will leave audiences in awe for years to come,positive
928,better than the part one the plot is way more clear and intriguing though not that complex or full of conspiracies pretty fancy the black and white bizarre circus arena incredibly integrating the tremendous symbol of power with a peculiar fright to tell the truthi have not read any of the dune novels whereas paul is seen as a goodshaped character from my view hes mercifulperhaps not anymore ruthless revengeful and curled into a crazy plotted thousandyearlong plan zendaya plays her part well i could sense chani has her different look on the warthe part two isnt perfect though it just tells us a game of throne a story of alien version nazarene messiahs revenge without much ups and downs and is easy to see through also the switch point is too simple to make us fully understand the reasons behind paul finally take his mind to be the lisan al gaib and i doubt if the designed fate of the houses can go on so smoothly as the prophecy says that is somehow unreal to me,positive
929,if u find painful to watch u can skip this part dont believe those movie reviews that part pace is fast and exciting than its still boring and feel sleepy every min have a scene zendaya will look at timothee to create a boring romance both actor totally no chemistry build up powerful villain at part part become a tools to build another villain fight scene is stiff and not exciting bastita only know how to roar when failed his missionso what u have a big universe story great cinematographybgm and cast actor totally no connection with each other years ago story already fall behind today writing this movie is a combination of got avatar and star war but fail miserably cannot compare with these,negative
930,there is not many near hour films i could sit through and stay not only entertained but totally connected to the story this film went beyond my expectations it is hard sometimes making a sequel and living up to the first movie but it did just that i totally agree with the director that you could watch the second installment without watching the first but you would be missing out everything from the cinematography sound music to the story itself i was awestruck by the finished product though the film does start out slow it quickly picks up and runs with it i very much look forward to part as it leaves you with much more to the adventure still to be told in my opinion this is by far one of the greatest films i have seen in recent years,positive
931,a sci fi epic the plot is immersive the story moves at pace i was hooked on the old as well as the new characterisations austin butler is sinister this was an enthralling visual experience with amazing scenery costumes and a distinctive orange filter making the desert landscapes and scenes ethereal the soundtrack was thundering and embellished every scene throughout glad i watched part again before this and ill be seeing this for a second time tomorrowbattle scenes are hectic the low camera keeps you tight into the action the style infused into part are the same but the tone has changed now its about vengeance and victory religion politics power and romance what a mixi left wanting more and thats what well get in part,positive
932,although today without having reviewed it i am aware that it was not like that during my childhood it seemed to me that dozens of years passed between installments and of harry potter this because with the economy as limited as it can be having a child of approximately years old i raised money to purchase the first trilogy of the saga and a godmother gave me the fourth film when it was just released without exaggeration i saw those movies hundreds of times without fear of being wrong i could say that i know them almost by heart from so many days i saw them i never took into account the future releases that were coming and when i learned of their existence my excitement and my love for cinema began to flourishthats exactly what i want to do with dune and dune part two i want to watch them again and again and again until i wear out the digital copy on max or whatever platform theyre going to be released on in a few months i want all my friends and people close to me to see them so i can talk about them and understand things that i may not have even paid attention to at firsti was simply delighted with everything this film gave us technical aspects story script acting etc but as always mainly when i tell the story of paul atreides and how well it is told i have nothing more to say than praise for the productionit is the second audiovisual material the first was the invincible series that i found so good that i had or have the need to visit the source material solely to learn more about this universe,positive
933,i went to go see dune yesterday on a whim at an immersive imax big screen theater although i usually just view movies in regular theaters i am delighted of my experienceit was a breathtaking must see experience all of the cinematography was beautiful captivatingthe universe felt alive realistic partly because it wasnt committing the grave story telling sin of attempting to tell rather than show as a lot of modern stories do when theres a massive expansive universe to cover in the film formatdune was filled with breath taking cinematography and sounds that would take you on the edge of your seat as you felt your body reacting to it as if you were in the world yourselfdune part ii is true art in logos pathos and ethosit all makes clear logical sense both in the narrative the characterss thoughts decisions feelings behavior actionsit evokes a strong emotional response and puts tension in the viewers seatit clearly portrays the themes of religious beliefs in a fair ethical manner without insulting either the faithful or the faith lesss intelligence or trying to tell them what to believe merely shows how all of the beings in the dune universe come to their faith explores themes of why humans have need faith in the face of suffering or adversityas it is said all human beings were created to worship something and if nots not a messiah or some god or divine entity it will be other things like spice for instance or power or a dictator or sex money love themselves being trapped in self centric thinking of the ego prideful mind etcdune also intelligently embodies the masculine the feminine in its elements of its characters flawlessly showcasing how both women men have each essence within themselves,positive
934,the best film i have ever seen in the fantasy films category the technology used for this film is probably very modern because the effects are excellent watch the full dune movie online if you want to do it from the comfort of your home but i hope you have a good monitor because it would be a shame to miss the great show and effectsthere is certainly a difference between watching this movie online and watching it in the cinema as it is obvious that you will see more interesting details on the cinema screen but you may be distracted by other viewers who will surely enjoy this spectacle they may make strange noises,positive
935,one of the best movies ive ever seen in my life stunning cinematography a wellcrafted story rare errors that are almost unnoticeable and unparalleled acting performances from the entire cast if you have not seen the movie yet i advise you to watch it immediately especially in imax to enjoy the full experience an amazing movie there is not a dull moment many events follow and the sequences are more than wonderful the movie tries to introduce you into the world of the freeman after the first hour i almost know their customs and responses they did things as if i belonged to them and on top of all of this the scenes are great and the angles make you feel ecstatic the opening scene is terrible and the ending scene is beyond excellent an epic movie the action is new and the method of fighting is unfamiliar there are some light comedic scenes but they really made me laugh and the imax experience is truly awesome the screen is truly awesome it is huge the quality is amazing and the audio experience is truly one of the most enjoyable things that can be seen to sum up my experience this movie can be put in the best movies i have ever seen in my life thank you,positive
936,massive disappointment i know the book a little and i knew where the story was going but the outcome is worse than i expected i liked the first film its grandiose settings its open questions the way the second responds is quite appallingthat the emperors throne comes down to a knife fight is already hard to swallow but whats more it ends with the good old trick of its the hero who is dead ah no its the other one already seen a million times in film its disappointingaesthetically the story immensely reduces the ambitions of this second part by focusing on the fremens and their rough desert settings with the exception of a scene on the harkonnen planet giedi prime which is rather impressive in martial white and black tones that said i still miss david lynchs crazy and disgusting harkonnen with their strange greenishindustrial planet and sexual perversionshere we are in a demonstration of pure force strangely contradicted by the ridiculous fear suddenly displayed by rabban and by an astonishing vulnerability of the harkonnen troops like the sardaukars to the guerrilla techniques of the fremens without this being convincingly justified by the miseenscenewe can only imagine that what makes the difference is the infinitely superior number of the fremen greatly underestimated by the harkonnen which allows them to gain the upper hand at the cost of a major human sacrifice but this quasigenocidal aspect is only evoked by a film which obviously must be easy on the general public to be profitable here we touch on the structural limits of the project,positive
937,this movie made me write my first review it is an engrossing and mesmerising cinematic marvel on track to be one of the greatest scifi movies of all time a perfect sequel jampacked equally with epic action and mystical realities and accompanied by a stellar score from hans zimmer this movie stuck in my head for days after watching itas a die hard fan of dune seeing the adaptation of frank herberts magnum opus said to be unadaptable on the wide screen was a dream come true the movie is a must watch on the big screen and a treat to behold for fans and casual watchers alike solid,positive
938,the movie felt rushed it felt disconnected to its predecessor and missed to impress on a lot of areas sure it was visually stunning other than there wasnt much i liked about it hopefully they can resurrect in the finalenearly hours to build something magical and incredible like they did in the first film and they dropped the ball the acting was inconsistent and disappointing not sure how you flop this bad when the first film was done so righthowever that being said usually the second film of a trilogy is to build the story which they did in this film i liked the original dune better in this regard even though they didnt give us much lets see if they can close the series out properly,positive
939,i recently watched dune and i must say i wasnt very impressed unless youre an avid dune fan or have read the book its quite difficult to follow a significant issue is the lack of a recap of the first film at the start which leaves viewers who havent recently watched dune at a disadvantagemany book adaptations stray too far from the novel but dune appears to have the opposite problem it seems to follow the novel so closely at times that it fails as a movie the film feels episodic and lacks a coherent rhythm or pace hardcore scifi enthusiasts might love it but for the average generalist movie watcher its a hard slogfrom a narrative perspective the film is overly dark and lacks the lighter moments that bring contrast to a story this results in a plot that feels flat and onedimensional overall dune might satisfy diehard fans of the series but it falls short for those seeking a more balanced and engaging cinematic experience,positive
940,what truly sets this movie apart is its ability to provoke thought beneath its scifi veneer lies a poignant commentary on the realworld issues of wealth disparity and social injustice challenging viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about our world i would say that dune part is more than just a movie its a powerful cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll from its breathtaking visuals to its compelling narrative every aspect of this film is crafted with meticulous detail and precision with its stunning visuals gripping story and thoughtprovoking themes its a mustsee for anyone who appreciates the art of filmmaking,positive
941,just walked out of the imax theater a mustsee format btw and i was so blown away by the rigor of this film incredible adaptation of the screenplay stacked cast and jawdropping cinematography on every frame one highlight though is the level of emotion that are being played within the film is insane its an experienceis it confusing even though the movie touched on herberts idea of politics and religion but denis carried us through seamlessly not even a boring part exists as i believe that there are more difficult and challenging materials dune part two nailed the storyline for meplease go watch and experience this since you wont get to see this kinds of movie often,negative
942,boy oh boy where do i even begin dune honey my pookie bear i have loved you ever since i first laid eyes on you the way you drive into the cinemas and strike fear into your viewers eyes your silky smooth cinematography around the rim and that gorgeous cast i would do anything for you i wish it were possible to freeze time so i would never have to watch you retire you had a rough childhood but you never gave up hope you are even amazing off the court youre a great husband and father sometimes i even call you dad i forvever dread and weep thinking of the day you will one day retire i would sacrifice my own life it were the only thing that could put a smile on your beautiful face,positive
943,i have never written a review for any movie on imdb but now i just had to because this was a masterpiece i feel like most movies these days which people are excited about just flop but the dune movies have a great potential of going down as one of the best in history timothe chalamet was outsanding ive only seen this one the first one and interstellar that is with him he is incredible the battle scenes in this movie was incredible got so nervous at the final battle and of course hans zimmer strikes again with perfect music this is star wars level no doubt a from me i cant wait for the next one,positive
944,a monumental piece of cinema great visual great story great writingbest scifi movies to datethe only disappointing thing is not making a hours film with more extra scenes to absorb the story of dune to its finestdune part two is a cinematic masterpiece that takes the audience on an incredible journey through the harsh desert landscape of arrakis and flows with spice in the air the movie is an adaptation of frank herberts classic sciencefiction novel and it is the second installment of the dune franchise directed by denis villeneuve the film is a visual spectacle that showcases the directors mastery of the art of filmmakingthe movie follows the story of paul atreides a young boy who is destined to become the leader of the desert planet arrakis the planet is known for its valuable resource the spice which is essential for space travel the story is set in a futuristic world where humanity has colonized other planets and is ruled by powerful families the atreides family is tasked with taking control of arrakis from the harkonnens who have been in charge of the planet for many yearsthe films visual effects are stunning and the artists behind them have shown creativity and dedication that is second to none the world of arrakis is brought to life with incredible attention to detail and the landscapes are aweinspiring the sand dunes the gigantic sandworms and the futuristic technology are all seamlessly integrated into the story making the audience feel like they are part of the fremen and living with them seeing what happened with the same eyethe acting is also outstanding timothee chalamet delivers a powerful performance as paul atreides bringing depth and complexity to the character rebecca ferguson and zendaya are also excellent in their roles bringing a sense of depth into their characters the cast is rounded out by talented actors such as austin butler florence pugh and christopher walken who all deliver outstanding performancesthe story of dune part two is compelling and engaging and it is excellently laid out the film has a good pacing which is better than the first one and never feels tedious at any moment the pacing is just great and the story unfolds in a way that keeps the audience engaged from beginning to end the movie is a testament to the power of storytelling and it is a reminder that great storytelling is timelessone of the most impressive aspects of dune part two is the way it balances action and drama the film is not just a scifi adventure it is also a characterdriven drama that explores themes such as family power and destiny the action scenes are thrilling and wellexecuted but they never feel gratuitous or overthetop they are always in service of the story and they help to advance the plot and develop the charactersoverall dune part two is a movie that will leave you in awe it is a cinematic masterpiece that showcases the best of what modern filmmaking has to offer if you are a fan of science fiction or the dune franchise then this movie is a mustsee it is a movie that will stay with you long after the credits roll i was just so happy to experience it,positive
945,i loved this movie but i dont need to write a whole review like everyone else do you book readers that a movie adaptation does not need to have every single thing you want from the book an adaptation is based off the book not an exact copy of it if they wanted to fit everything wed have a hour long movie but we cant add everything can we lower your expectations yall are embarrassing yourselves all youre doing is yapping about how much of a fan you are let people enjoy the movie adaptation not the copy you wantlike yeah i love the spacing guild theyre awesome i love the lore behind the eradication of robots but that would be an extra like hours and a movie cant be so long that it wastes everyones day with lore right this behavior is truly goofy and it needs to stop,positive
946,i absolutely love part every scene was a tableau understanding such a complex story was made easy with the help of a well timed and thought out editing i was thrilled to see how different and good this part was from the first moviepart on the other hand is weirdly edited veeeerry long at first and the hero moves at the speed of light sometimes and the esthetically perfect tableaus are no more scenes are as standard as can be such as they are in any hollywood movie as a result the tale i was so thrilled about becomes a regular good storysuch a shame i liked itbut man it could have been epic,positive
947,when i saw the first movie i could tell it was many used to build up to this one and it showed dune is one of my favorite movies it could just be that i love scifi but there is really nothing to complain about my favorite movie is interstellar even though this movie is very different they both involve space and i love the genre a strongpoint of this movie is the soundtrack and cinematography which is also a strongpoint of interstellar i will probably see this movie many more times on streaming i will also see dune messiah as soon as it comes out i totally recommend this movie to anyone,positive
948,saw it yesterday not better than part part gave enough time to establish all characters here few important thing or eventa are rushed also bgm is not great like part last mintues were very rushed overall a good movie but not better than part zendaya timothee florence rebecca austin walkenbardem brolin all were good in their partspart talked more with facial expressions eyes of characters alongside backgroubd music this one has his great scenes too but nd half somehow lacks that perfection for mecgi was also good but that oscar worthy bgm was seriosly missing for me,positive
949,i read dune shortly after it was published and have been a fan ever since having read most of the canonthe first attempt at filming the book in was flawed but i felt it was a valiant attemptdune part was not too bad and promised to be a reasonable version it was missing some plot elements whose absence i couldnt really fathom especially as there was a further three hoursworth to come but i was willing to give them a pass on that pending the second partsaw part yesterday truly disappointing important elements missed outdistorted needlessly flaws in the detailsunlikely scenarios and clear inaccuracies in the way some things were portrayed there was plenty of the time that was devoted to big explosions etc that could have been better used in depicting the worthwhile missing aspects of the bookdefinitely not recommended to be honest i am not sure why ive given it two stars maybe i just dont have it in me to downgrade something with frank herberts name on it to the lowest possible grade,positive
950,i will not go into spoilers but i watched this yesterday i thought the cinematography and to choreography were brilliant the lack of non diegetic sounds in some scenes made for very tense engagements between characters i would seriously recommend this to any sci fi enjoyers as well as anyone interested in impactful film making it should be said that the performance of actors was also impeccable i think this may be chalamets greatest area for acting yet i will also add my personal liking to the visuals of the desert settings however the choice to alter the lighting to monochromatic in once certain sequence i will not refer to it to avoid spoilers but you will probably understand upon watching the film was simply outstanding and provides us to a completely different lifestyle and aesthetic to a different society within the greatly expansive narrative of dune,positive

955,dune proved to be a sublime continuation of the captivating narrative that left me hanging after the first installment the storytelling in this sequel reached new heights seamlessly weaving complex characters political intrigue and profound conflicts each plot twist was meticulously crafted keeping me enthralled and engaged from start to finish the film delved deeper into the intricacies of the dune universe delivering a rich and immersive experience that truly satisfied the cravings of fans eagerly awaiting more from frank herberts masterpiecewhat truly set dune apart however was its visual spectacle the film showcased breathtaking landscapes of arrakis and introduced intricately designed sandworms that were nothing short of aweinspiring the meticulous attention to detail combined with cuttingedge cinematography brought the dune world to life in ways that exceeded my expectations the visual prowess of the movie particularly during the exhilarating scenes where the fremen and house atreides orchestrated a meticulously coordinated assault unleashing a symphony of destruction from every conceivable angle this almost compelled me to rise from my seat in sheer excitement dune not only met but surpassed expectations setting an exceptionally high standard for the future of the franchise,positive
956,dune went pretty much downhill in the second part the whole story feels fully constructed and is full of flaws and plot holes like in the beginning they raid a harvester which has support legs even though it runs on tracks they put a lot of effort into hiding behind those legs and then shot down a fighter after that they destroy the harvester with powerful lasers before and after that scene all harvester do not have these legs also on the following raid they can kill the harvester with lasers even while multiple fighters fly around why did they not shoot down the fighters with the lasers first why those lasers never been used before by anybody not even in the fight sword vs sword nobody is using lasers except the desert people then the means of transport is riding a worm why does the worm stay on the surface why it doesnt dive they said if worms meet they fight to the death yet they can ride worms parallel and they seem to get along then at one scene he drinks the water of life and suddenly everybody else is there wasnt he just in the north and said he cant go south whereas everybody else went south how was he there first and how did everybody else show up after he drank why did he not drink after his mother had a sip why the old mother said they made a mistake when she realized the pregnancy after watching the movie it just felt like the story was written so its reaching the desired end no matter the means to me this all made no sense in the end lots of points for cast and fx,positive

961,dune part two emerges as a cinematic tour de force encapsulating the essence of frank herberts classic with an execution that can only be described as visually and auditorially mesmerizing director denis villeneuves vision transcends the confines of traditional science fiction elevating this film into a realm of unparalleled immersion where the desolate beauty of arrakis and the intricate complexities of herberts universe are brought to life with staggering clarity and emotional depththe visuals in dune part two are nothing short of breathtaking villeneuve along with cinematographer greig fraser crafts a visual palette that is as vast and sweeping as the dunes themselves each frame is a meticulously designed masterpiece capturing the stark beauty of the desert landscape the opulence of the imperial court and the visceral intensity of the fremens struggle the use of practical effects augmented by judicious cgi creates a tactile realism that grounds the storys fantastical elements in a palpable reality the sweeping shots of arrakiss desert the intricate designs of the spaceships and technology and the hauntingly beautiful sietches of the fremen are rendered with such detail and care that they become characters in their own righthans zimmers score complements the visuals to create an immersive experience that is truly extraordinary his music for dune part two is both haunting and evocative weaving traditional middle eastern motifs with futuristic synths to underscore the films themes of destiny power and transformation the score ebbs and flows with the narrative amplifying the emotional resonance of key moments from the thunderous clashes of battle to the intimate whispers of prophecy zimmers ability to capture the soul of herberts universe in his compositions adds a layer of depth to the film that transcends the visual spectacle ensnaring the audience in a sensory embrace that is both exhilarating and deeply movingfor fans of the original novels dune part two offers a nuanced interpretation of paul atreides journey that both honors and challenges herberts intentions in the books particularly in dune messiah herbert sought to subvert the traditional heros journey by presenting paul as a deeply flawed figure whose rise to power brings about not salvation but suffering this film bravely embraces that complexity depicting paul not as the unblemished hero many have come to expect but as a young man grappling with the weight of prophecy the seductions of power and the moral ambiguities of his actionsthis portrayal of paul is a bold narrative choice reflecting a deeper understanding of herberts critique of the hero myth by emphasizing pauls darker impulses and the consequences of his decisions dune part two challenges viewers to reconsider their perceptions of leadership heroism and destiny its a testament to timothe chalamets performance that paul remains a compelling if increasingly troubled protagonist chalamet captures the internal conflict of a character caught between destiny and desire bringing a nuanced depth to paul that is both captivating and unsettlingthe decision to delve into the darker aspects of pauls character aligns with herberts own reflections on the misinterpretation of dune herbert was concerned that readers glorified paul as a hero missing the cautionary tale of power and its pitfalls this film rectifies that presenting a vision of paul that is more in line with herberts intentions and in doing so enriches the narrative with complexity and ambiguitydune part two is a masterful continuation of villeneuves adaptation a film that not only captures the grandeur and majesty of herberts universe but also engages with its most challenging themes the combination of stunning visuals a captivating score and a willingness to explore the moral complexities of its protagonist makes this film a remarkable achievement its a cinematic experience that not only entertains but also invites reflection on the nature of power heroism and the human condition solidifying its place as a landmark in science fiction filmmaking,positive
962,dune part is truly amazing in terms of story music visuals and characters the film is almost hours long but it doesnt feel like it because the storyline is not boring and each character is also not wasted a masterpiece in the midst of superhero films that are starting to get bored and have no clear direction as a sequel dune starts the story without missing a beat paul atreides timothee chalamet and his mother lady jessica rebecca ferguson continue their adventure on the desert planet arrakisout of the clutches of the harkonnen they try to join the fremen including chani zendaya who appeared several times in pauls dreams in the first film as paul tries to understand their customs lady jessica tells the fremen that her son is the leader they have been waiting for according to the prophecydenis villeneuve succeeded in presenting perfect details the worlds he creates are stunning from the desert of arrakis to majestic palaces the appearance of giant sandworms and neatly choreographed battle scenes are entertainment for those who enjoy the scifi action genre villeneuve succeeded in transforming the visuals from frank herberts novel beautifully in every scenedune also presents deep and interesting characters timothee chalamet takes paul atreides to new heights with a compelling performance just the right amount of charismatic and intimidating conveying the complexity of pauls character ideally zendaya who previously only appeared a few times in dune part one now has the opportunity to explore chanis character as a strong and brave figurethe presence of supporting roles such as lady jessica and princess irula florence pugh also adds to the complexity of the political complexities in the world created by villeneuve javier bardem as stilgar also gave an extraordinary performance that will stick in the audiences memory likewise austin butler who previously impressed through elvis again displays his eccentric and memorable role,positive
963,dune part is the best scifi film of all time and its not even close the music the cinematography the dialogue the action what could you possibly compare it to has to be up there with the best in terms of sequels as well as it outmatches the dune part one in every single way possible i will be thinking about this film forever and i cant wait to see it again i am usually let down when a movie has this much hype but this one truly lives up to it and then some i will say that walken as the emperor could have been done better and perhaps played by someone else but that does not take away from the brilliance of this film go see it now in imax if you can it is truly breathtaking bravo,positive
964,this was such a good movie there is so much suspense and action make sure you wanted the first one a couple days before if you havent read the book it can be harder to follow overall amazing the scenes were shot well theres a bit of an unsettling scary feeling in some scenes that i love it has a great cast there isnt a bad actor in the whole movie if you like movies about fighting supernatural and people banning together this is for you there are almost heroic moments in the movie you really have trouble telling if there are even any good and bad guys at all it is one of those movies that really gets you thinking you cant guess the plot its always throwing you for a loop,positive
965,nearly three years after the first part we finally get a contination of the dune story cant say some parts of the movie made my jaw drop to the ground though some sequences were kind of meh dont get me wrong the movies good it has marvelous special effects and computer graphics action packed scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat with those realistic looking explosions and people falling left and right but what it also has some significant downsides that diluted my otherwise good perception of this moviebut lets start with the good things firstthe cast is exceptional from the main characters to the extras i liked the fact that they made all factions in this movie look and feel distinct with different languages names costumes and coor schemes with cast of wellknown actors such as christopher walken zendaya dave bautista i especially want to commend the acting of timothe chalamet the scene where paul atreides proclaimed himself as the prophet and the leader of the fremens really gave me goosebumpsthe sound design in this movie is superb whether its the sound of hot blazing desert sand blasting the face of the main character when he mounts a desert worm explosions gunshots swords clashing make your adrenaline levels go through the roof making you feel like its you whos fighting therespecial effects and computer graphics are simply gorgeous from alien skylines with celestial objects visible in the sky to nuclear warheads exploding all done too well this movie is simply beautifulnow lets get to the problems this movie hasthe main problem for me is that all fights in this movie except the last one is onesided entire movie is harkonnen dummies getting slaughtered left and right by some desert dwellers that dont even have ranged weapons even though harkonnen possess aviation machine guns long range sniper rifles rockets and they just get slaughtered in the open in melee fights without even giving much resistance and we supposed to think that they are some kind of warrior caste a huge let down in that department problem with this is that they dont seem too much of a formidable enemy and because of that stakes are low from the start of the movie when fremens just completly utterly destroy squad of harkonnens without any losses we just know that paul atreides and fremens arent in any trouble fighting these guys which makes battles not that interesting the batistas character death was very underwhelming and a huge letdown the fight itself was less than seconds and as i just mentioned before very onesided the one and only decent fight was between paul and feydrautha the stakes very high and it was a very beautifully choreographed fightthe second problem is that paul atreides abilities feel undeserved he barely escaped with his life in the first movie and in the second he just starts dropping harkonnens left and right and in the finale even gains some kind of godlike ability that lets him see past future and read minds kind of mary sue characteras a conclusion i would like to say that it was a solid movie and i enjoyed it wholeheartedly and if you wonder what to watch on the week end i would gladly recommend you this flick,positive

967,too many grand entries too much emphasis on minute movements in the heat of a fight and drifting frames for calm scenes make it boring towards the end it is hard to stay put and concentrate on he story a lot of little things were included which made the bigger things less important the translation of the book was too close literary and thus was confusing the essence lost it felt like a dogged translation a little distance from the book would have helpedalso a unique story would have been nice if nothing else was working with such amazing actors what couldnt you have done and with that budget you could throw the audience in an awe,positive
968,every scene is a clip of its own and there is nothing connecting themto break down the plot fight scene timothy and zendaya kiss scene fighting some more then some weird post apocaliptic bad guys rambling about spices some more fight scene another cgi scene then repeat once morehonestly after every scene i counted the minutes they wasted of my life it is probably the worst film ive seeni completely understand why it has such a high rating you can have chalamet and zendaya in an instagram reel and make it to imdb top list apparentlyi might have liked it if i was a member of the genz unfortunately im not and im dragged to see this garbage by my wife who is genzall in all garbage movie but i love spending time with my wife so i finished it,positive

971,okay diehard dune book fans this is no disrespect to the book in which i love however for as wonderful as herberts universe is often the female characters are underdeveloped and lack agency villeneuve recognises this and we gain a more nuanced and complex chani irulan and jessica chani perhaps gains the most development with her actively pushing against pauls plans and featuring alongside him during major battles zendaya is perfectly cast she brings an emotional weight to chanis character that i have always found to be missed opportunity within the first bookusually im against directors making major changes within book to film adaptations and as the first film was fairly truthful to its source i was intrigued to how this would change with part major changes are made most obviously being a smaller time jump in which we miss out of on the brith of alia thank goodness because while i am a fan of alia within the book an adultchild hybrid portrayed through live action is risky and often falls flat renesmee anyone i felt we still gained the importance of alias presence and also a great addition of anya taylor joy who hopefully we get to see more of in potential sequelsarguably this is one of the most stunning films ever made with attention to detail coming in an abundance if you enjoyed the first then run to see it i often hear complaints from people that nothing happens during the part one try part two as i challenge you to not be bored during this delicious sequel,positive

973,known for his skinny and boyish look i was nervous about the transformation necessary to play the part of matured paul chalamet was perfect for the comingofage stage of pauls character and he nailed his part in part one and the first hour of part two but could he play the part of a bloodthirsty military leader hellbent on revenge and later the role of a reluctant emperor of the known universeyes chalamet exudes charisma he has in him a powerful masculine voice and is able to deliver combat sequences well his depressed and sullen acting perfectly embodies the curse and the pain of prescience the tragic necessity of the golden path at the expense of the prescient minds humanityseeing him play the part of a messianic military leader i wouldnt mind seeing chalamet try a hand in playing an action hero after bulking up a bit,positive

976,note i am more or less combining the two movies in one review since it really is one movie in two installments similar to the lord of the rings movies by peter jacksonthe short of it is these two movies will go down in history as two of the greatest sffantasy movies of all time these films capture the feel of the novel as not just sf about highlyadvanced technology but also about sophisticated societies and mysticism which puts it into the realm of science fantasy as it is sometimes called similar to star wars simultaneously the movie has a superb balance between aweinspiring wars and the emotions of the main characters the best description might be the foundation series by isaac asimov meets lord of the rings by tolkienwhen dune written by frank herbert was published in by chilton a publisher mainly of auto repair book manuals no less nothing like it had ever appeared in sf before it wasnt only the scope the action taking place among several politically and culturally sophisticated societies on a planet called arrakis aka dune some of the novels by robert heinlein did have some similar elements but herbert brought a new depth which had yet to be explored in sfherbert combined several elements which had rarely if ever been assembled in a single sf novel beforefirst a galactic political structure inspired by the italian citystates of the late middle ages and renaissance the galaxy is run by an emperor and twelve noble houses and the rivalry between the houses of atreides and harkonnen form the core of the events paul atreides the central character is the son of duke atreides and heir to its rule harkonnen is ruled by baron harkonnen who gives a new definition to the word overweight harkonnen may have been inspired by the medicis of florence and maybe house atreides loosely inspired by the house of mocenigo in venice or he simply made each house their own character of course the baddies are house harkonnen bald albinos where there is very little individuality almost like clonessecond a trade commodity with high demand indigenous to arrakis is the spice melange which is only found on arrakis which makes dune a prize possession in the galaxy melange has both healing and even regenerative capabilities as well euphoric effects making it the most highlysoughtafter commodity in the galaxythird sophisticated societies on arrakis there are several cultural societies some friendly others more adversarial there are the fremen who are native to dune and divided up into several different groups one of which believes in the prophecy of a savior while another looks at the world from a more secular view sound familiarthere is also the bene gesserit an interplanetary matriarchal society with mystique powers they have elements of a roman catholic convent with those of the knights templar they are mostly nonviolent but use their mystique powers to wield power over the other houses lady jessica is a bene gesserit and pauls motherand then a random impediment what makes mining the spice melange so challenging is that giant sandworms roam all over dune they are about as long as a two tower bridge with a height and width of about six trains they are attracted by static repeating sounds which makes avoiding them very difficultall these elements combined into a messianic and militaristic adventure at the highest level incredible movie adapted from an incredible book,positive
977,too easy to define it as impressive for sfx for acting for fair and huge effort to adaptate a masterpieceit is just a cathedral it is memorable at whole defining the hard effort of a so ambitious director but i recognized i am not one of its fans not animated by enthusiasm without ignore than i like it a film proposing many gifts great scene by scene having the virtue to explore in pasionned manner the noveltwo good points for me the white gray of harkonnen indeed not exactly the harkonnen imagined by herbert and the nice option for emperor i was seduced at whole by the work of javier bardem and i keep same question after the first part is timothee chalamet the best option for paul atreides i do not knowit is not my favorit adaptation old and conservative i remains prisoner of more modest tv series of but i applaused and i appreciated this second delightful imperial second part,positive
978,i am quite disappointed with this movie im even sure if it deserves a i loved dune part one so much amazing movie the storytelling was on point and despite the fact that it was super long it never got boringin this movie i feel like you could make it one hour long and not much will change it was quite boring and of course it ended on a cliffhangerone of the worst things about it in my opinion was the fact that most of the actors didnt articulate well i could not for the life of me tell you what the movie was about if i didnt watch it with subtitles you could not understand anything of what they were sayingi feel like my opinion is quite uncommon because all of the ratings i saw beforehand were praising the movie maybe that was the reason i was expecting for it to be spectacular because for me not many movies deserve a and i was just looking though these reviews seeing overall i am pretty upset that i couldnt give it more than it just doesnt deserve it,positive
979,what a strange pacing the movie felt rush despite being hmany scenes are reminiscent of the first feature without adding anything to the story andor the development of the characters arcsthe visuals are great but it doesnt makes it for everything unfortunately its structure has the same borrowing feeling of campbells heros journey from star wars a new hope being also years late despite having a better source material from the book unfortunately not used that much efficientlythe sides are defined with a manichean style the antagonists dont have any substance unfortunately house harkonnen is full of bad guys the whole arc introducing feydrautha is honestly anecdotalthe movie also clearly lacks of stakes due to a confusing editing style where the epic scenes are rushed down making you feel like all the meaningful deaths were used in the first entrance giving absolutely thrilling moments despite once again a truly achievement in terms of visuals and sound design the two value added seeing it in theaters imooverral its hard to recommend a movie being so safe and dull participating to the slowly decay of an industry that struggle to reinventing itself counting only on franchising and uniforming formulas of mythical stories maybe the third installment will leave a better taste well see,positive
980,dune part is worth a watch multiple watches even on the biggest screen with the best sound available it is pure imax wonder the cinematography is gorgeous the music and sound eerie and unsettling at all the appropriate moments the direction is wonderful and the characterization brilliant the plot follows the spirit of the books if you are a fan of the books there are certain critiques to be had which are valid from a fan who knows what theyre talking about however if you are to introduce a newbie to dunepart and part here are a great way to do so i cant imagine how many people will read the dune series because of this film watching pauls character arc is worthwhile and satisfying and the main thread of the film the supporting castcharacters arguably steal the show which says a lot about them because chalamet did wonderfully and yes all the disappointed zendaya fans from part for her lack of screen time you get to see more of zendaya in this one there are twists and turns in the story that will keep you guessing and even leave you feeling deeply unsettled because well thats dunes story the fight scenes have intense tension characterization storytelling and drama this movie is a classic in the making and a sight to behold bravo,positive
981,denis villeneuves dune has personally done for me what revenge of the sith done for many parents watching it when it first released the development of the story of paul atreides is shaping itself to be a tragic one reflective of the story in the book paul muaddib is sadly taking his own anakinlike route down this fictional universewhat dune established is further cemented and cemented very well by dune denis villeneuve has delivered a groundbreaking addition into the sciencefiction genre and it is one that in comparison to its sluggish predecessor is one to remember there are emotions here and such a connection to this universe that is crafted that cannot be said to not be genuinely making you want to see moreas we follow the story of the fremen and paul atreides timothee chalamet fulfilment of his true legacy we start to wrestle with the dangerous idea of faith and despair for the struggles of the fremen can only be ended by the arrival of the lisan al gaib this being a sacrificial path to take the world building denis villeneuve puts into play is to me like none other that weve seen for a long time of course dune is equally as amazing yet what dune manages to add on is just unbelievableregarding the casting there are some soontocome oscars whose rightful owners should belong to the cast of dune timothee chalamet for one has undoubtedly proven himself in recent years as one of this generations acting powerhouse from his flamboyant portrayal of willy wonka to his role as the deeply confused teenager elio in call me by your name his portrayal of paul atreides in this installment of the dune universe is gripping and impactful we are seeing a troubled villain in the making and his portrayal of the religiously haunted saint of the fremen is incredible as he balances saving those he cares about with discovering who he truly is as for chani played by the talented zendaya there is not much to say due to sheer awe zendaya is an emotional lead and a powerhouse at the front of the fremen she embodies the struggles of the people of the dunes battling the corruption of religious fanaticism i was also very charmed and taken off guard by the sheer excellence of austin butlers feydrautha the new governor of arrakis to say he may be the best villain since heath ledgers much respected joker would not be undeserving praise however feydrautha sadly suffers from the issue that comes with killing a villain off too quickly being that his true potential is not fully witnessed it was also very nice to see the lovely javier bardem play both a religiously devoted fanatic and timothee chalamets biggest hypeman though i do wish dennis villeneuve had explored more the gripping conflict plaguing his mind due to stilgar being a plagued man in the books struggling with his devotion to this prophecy as for the rest of the supporting cast whose roles though at times did not take the spotlight as much dont leave much to be said except for sheer appreciation for such a passionate portrayal rebecca ferguson stepping into the reverend mother identity of lady jessica and giving up a lot of the things she cared for is such a sad portrayal of a mothers sometimes sacrificial role equally josh brolin avengers endgame no country for old men and his portrayal of gurney is better than ever with his character truly being such a good shoulder to lean on for our young atreides the whole cast is deserving of so many applauds for their chemistry and ability to connect to bring this universe alive never felt more connected to a cast and their characters who i have now come to lovethe world of arrakis and its other less explored planets also never feels more alive and thats not because they are genuine real places but rather because greig frasers cinematography has managed to make the dunes of arrakis as real as possible the visuals to say they are captivating is an understatement this is a world that feels alive filled with grief and hopelessness in the very sands and through its very people the fremen greig fraser builds such a beautiful arrakis utilising the panavision hseries lenses and the rehoused soviet helios lens from the batman that it is simply mesmerising also absolutely loved the experimentation with feydrauthas black and white intro scene i always love when black and white is incorporated into modern cinema it gives films such a charmas for the soundtrack that is largely on repeat as this is being written from cornfield chase to a time of quiet between the worms hans zimmer once again develops his case for this generations and the pasts greatest composer the world of arrakis the emergence of the shaihulud and the evil of the harkonnenss cannot be bought to life without this soundtrack a time of quiet between the worms and its explosive counterpart beginnings are such delicate times are genuinely two soundtracks that have made me so reminiscent of gladiators now we are free another genius score from hans zimmerdenis villeneuves dune is deserving of a cinematic legacy to be remembered as one of those greats and equally to be loved for a film such as this comes once every years no movie in recent years has quite made me feel quite like a kid and taken me for hours to a completely different world people should genuinely give dune the chance it rightfully deserves and cherish this cinematic experience for it does not happen as often as we wish it would thank you denis for making this possible,positive
982,villeneuve is at the top of his game here technically this is an absolute masterpiece this is perfection in every way of filmmaking really i see elements and influences of star wars gladiator mad max metropolis and triumph of the will the black and white scenes in this are pure excellence beautifully horrifying the last dune won six oscars same crew this time some may not buy the chemistry between chalamet and zendaya and thats fair but the cast overall is a fantasy for many of us seeing brolin walken chalamet bardem skarsgard share the screen with pugh butler zendaya etc epic this film is timeless and will be a permanent top,positive
983,better than the first even for me its neat that with pauls omnipresence you could think of this as just another permutation in the multiverse that has played out and the updates are very welcome the baron from the previous film more autonomy for the women reflecting more overtly the culture and some much larger implications around the children of dune too the baby is not yet born but in the books by the time the showdown happens its been quite a few years also chani is very different i like that i dont know what will happen next despite reading the two trilogiesone thing that does bug me though is not including the water ceremony for jamis killed in the previous movie so not a spoiler the absolute best part of the book is paul having to carry jamis water afterward and the ceremony where people remember him in which paul says i was a friend of jamis he taught me that when you kill you pay for it and when he cries people say he gives water to the deadfor a more moral paul being portrayed in the movie its wild they didnt include it its a powerful moment,positive
984,dune part two is mesmerizing this is a sequel that we have been needing in the scifi genre for a long time now and i would even say that now we have these two movies its fair to say that these are already way better than star wars this movie delivered and exceeded all the expectations in visuals story music epic story and acting dune part two is the savior of scifi genre and one of the best films i have ever seenforget disney star wars this is a game changer i have already seen the movie twice and it truly gets better with every viewing if anyone needs a good movie to watch this is the movie they need,positive
985,dune part two is a visually stunning and narratively gripping movie that continues denis villeneuves adaptation of the beloved scifi series in an impressive manner the films phenomenal visuals score vfx and acting make the minute runtime feel too little to enjoy fully for the best experience i highly recommend watching it in an imax theatredenis villeneuve has done a fantastic job of taking the story from the book and transforming it into an epic second installment of his series as someone who loved the first movie i had high expectations but villeneuve managed to surpass them all this movie proves that he is the scifi director of our generation,positive
986,well this one has a lot more flow in it than the first one still there are parts where people are left wondering why they are added but are quite much less than what was in the first moviethe battles were more moving and more detailed the story was more directed still there was bloat but was more or less acceptablethe story was once again predictable and was easy to foresee the end of the movie in details actually actually i am quite sure what will happen in the third movie without ever reading the books or watching the old version of the moviethe parts that made me laugh as they were ridiculous and just not logical like the part where they run m in the sand to hid while leaving a clear trail behind to be found were scatteredoverall enjoyable movie but doubt i will watch it again,positive
987,denis yet again understands cinema and understands the source material his take on the story here elevates the source material in a way that can live alongside the bookdenis intentionally chooses what to focus the story on paul internal battle a forced prophecy a devotion to someone in the face of dutythe movie is clearly a spectacle and should be watched just on that but the movie also is very upfront about its themes more so than the book and the appreciation to denis on knowing what to change in the story to help elevate those themesi read the book and i have no qualms with the changes his made because it was all for the storyi applaud denis,positive
988,after enjoying part forgiving that films clearly incomplete feeling due to being a setup for part i was truly disappointed by this saw it in imax uks biggest screen which i have enjoyed for its realism especially sound in the past after about mins i realised the film was trying to pummel me into submission the body falling from some height onto the sandy desert floor made the sound of oppenheimers nuke test but truncated why to further remove any sense of realism my interest was piqued when paul set off on his required task of crossing a patch of desert being alerted to a number of major hazards on the way this was going to be of some interest nope we basically just cut to another scene the austin butlerpugh bedroom scene was cut the instance she asked him to put his hand in the boxcutting room floor no chemistry was allowed to develop between paul artreidis and chani etc in a good film i expect to have my feelings brain and heart involved ie making me a participant here i sat in my seat barring a few exceptions just a spectator,positive
989,dune part two has been universally hailed as a sequel worthy of terminator judgment day the godfather part ii and the empire strikes back a bonafide epic yielding additional comparisons to benhur and lawrence of arabia a picture that solidifies denis villeneuve as one of the modern titans of the art form even those who werent so hot on the first film finding its characters monotonous and its visuals largely dull seem to have been thoroughly won overand although i enjoyed the visuals and thought there was a purpose to their occasional drabness imposing brutalist structures towering over nature the new film indeed cranks the art direction up to eleven exemplifying some of the most potent visuals in scifi history although i thought the characters worked fine in the original in the sequel were treated to powerhouse newcomers and darker depths to the figures we know when critics said i liked dune part one just fine but i just cant buy timothe chalamet as the hero readers of the frank herbert novel snickered in part two new fans will see whyif nothing else they find that the whole thing feels more complete recall that the first movie bamboozled many who hadnt a clue it was just part one frank herberts son brian wrote when the new movie is combined with dune part one it is by far the best film interpretation of dune that has ever been doneother things that are expanded on andor elevated include the performances of zendaya one of the most expressive and loveable actors of her generation underused in the prior movie as chani the young fremen warrior who welcomed paul atreides into their camps after the fall of his house and rebecca ferguson as lady jessica pauls mother who becomes the reverend mother of the fremen who believe she and paul are instrumental to a prophecy of a mother and child sent to reclaim planet arrakis from oppression the imperial spicemining colonies that now belong to the vile harkonnen family on that note we also get a better look at the harkonnen homeworld whose black sun seems to erase all color from it bar the blackest of black and whitest of whitethis moment is one of many reasons you need to see this in a theater i cannot stress it enough these sequences from the most thunderous battles and sandworm rides to the intimate final duel that left my audience at the edge of their seats are paralyzing to behold in an auditorium complete with music and sound design that seem to make the very earth tremble then falling dead silent at pivotal moments all sublimely photographed by swirly bokeh extraordinaire greig fraser its not often you see a film and just know youre witnessing the creation of iconic images the action scenes are elevated by impressive choreography and of course the performancesthe most intense of the new faces is undoubtedly austin butler as feyd rautha thats the sting character in the movie in case you needed the reference lauded by many as the best villain performance since anton chigurh and ledgers joker additional newcomers include florence pugh as princess irulan la seydoux as lady fenring of the bene gesseret priestesses and christopher walken as emperor shaddam ivreturning actors include javier bardem as the fremen leader stilgar whose incorrigible fanaticism gets some big laughs josh brolin as gurney halleck who is out for harkonnen blood stellan skarsgrd as the revolting baron harkonnen dave bautista as the beast rabban who envies the affection the baron shows toward feyd and charlotte rampling as the imperial reverend mother who hatches schemes of her own certain characters ive mentioned are given just a few minutes of screen time yet they all make a considerable impact from the memorable line reads to the looks that speak even louder most notably during that final exchange of haunting glances between paul chani and the princessat the center is chalamet as paul muaddib atreides a performance that will vindicate his stans and make nonbelievers hopefully realize not only how formidable he can be but what he was truly going for in part one chalamet is known for his thin frame and his friendly demeanor yet we have absolutely no trouble believing that his paul would be a master of sparring and a conqueror of sandworms as i wrote earlier those who judged the first movie by how well his story works as a gardenvariety heros journey are bound to have an oh moment or twoif youre still worried that some of these elements seem lifted from other works recall that dune is likely an older series than whatever youre thinking of all the same even the familiar images feel new here epic in scale in a way that cinema hasnt been able to achieve until now this movie is a closetoperfect marriage of hitherto unthinkable technology and a crystalclear vision for said tech to realize in part the movie plays as if villeneuve heard the complaints of the previous film and as if on a dare went all the way with his movie magic for the sequel putting the doubters in their placeknowing how the books go i know this franchise is far from done and despite how long this film was i never wanted it to end and still crave more ergo im more than stoked to see what villeneuve does with the rest of herberts legendarium and if audiences keep finding resonance in his version of it the world of dune is a uniquely wellrealized potential future intimidatingly immense and outlandish on one hand and dreadfully convincing on the other showing that imperialism and colonialism may be alive and well millennia ahead had this film been made with even less studio interference the parallels between the fremens plight and palestine may have been even more obviousthe story of dune messiah still needs to be adapted and im confident that once villeneuve shows it to us the same media illiterates who started posting film twitter takes about how poor things approves of misogyny once that film came out on digital wont be taking pauls white savior and jessicas cultural appropriation at face value or so we may hope an interesting theory from walter chaw suggests that the reason so many people keep failing to get the point of dune and paul atreides specifically is that colonialism is so embedded in our value system as manifest destiny that its straightup impossible for some of us to interpret a figure like this as anything other than a good guy lisan algaib and all that,positive
990,i think there are so many things to talk about this movie so lets keep it simple this film is absolutely incredible its a masterpiece a work of art besides that i think this is also one of the most important films ever made it accomplishes so much on so many levels for example when was the last time we saw a sciencefiction movie with masterclass acting deep characters perfect cinematography immaculate sound design the list could go on and that is adapted from a novel but more specifically i believe this film showed us the true power of cgi and how to use it properly it was nearly invisible and it blended perfectly with the rest of the footage denis villeneuve just took us somewhere no one had ever been and it truly is an undescribable experience he made a perfect use of wide shots lenses and filters adding to that is the immaculate sound design hans zimmer yet again makes an incredible original score and villeneuve compliments it with the perfect background noises one thing is for sure though this is a movie to see in theatre for me this was the best theatre experience ever so if you can go see it i highly recommend to go see it before it leaves to go into streaming,positive
991,ill try keep this simple sothis is the exact type of movie you go to see on the big screen just literal jaw dropage the scale of this feels so massive and makes you feel so tiny in so many scenes and it blew me away the effects were so damn brilliant with some of the most stunning visuals you will ever be able to see from a movie the acting by the entire cast was completely from the top shelf with a special shoutout to austin butler his feydrautha was perfect and the score oooft it had me tapping my foot at times i also swear at some points i could smell the sand thats how immersed i was in this movieafter watching a couple more lower budget type scifi movies lately that are slightly different scifi genre like synchronic and freaks which i enjoyed both a lot to then go and watch dune part and just think yeahhhhh this is a whole other level i think i saw the budget for the new gladiator was million and dune part was million for this to look just as unbelievably amazing as it did with that budget it makes me think what the hell will they do with gladiator moneyive read the book and loved it ive seen part and and loved them some scenes in part in the movie were so much better than imagined from the book any scifi lover that doesnt like this movie ill be shocked its an absolute epic of the genre that i think will be hard to top anytime soon if at all everyone needs to see this on the big screen and lose yourself on the planet dunedenis villeneuve has nailed this and might be my favourite creator in the industry at the moment with nolan their tone and styles just extract the unreal i crave from cinema at the moment hopefully a lot more to come,positive
992,its a masterpiece you need to watch it carefully every scene detailing and on screen depiction of every scene is great outstanding special effects comparable to that of star wars there are one or two oscars waiting for it better than dune one keeps same expectations as dark knight rrr and mandalorianseries it is going to meet it watch it in imax if possible also in atmos sound system in hindi i can say bawaal movie acting is okayish but bgm special effects and story is awesome i have to write more words to submit the review but thats it dont miss it this is meant to be seen on big screens,positive
993,everything about this movie is so good that it practically made me numb i still cant even process it im a huge fan of the novels and in a few ways this movie manages to improve on the source material by giving us a very intimate rendition of this awesome storyit totally kicks ass on all fronts writing visuals sound designmusic and acting at its absolute highest levels on the grandest scale truly epic one of the best adaptations from novel to screen ever made no easy task either given the films source material but executed tastefully and dare i say flawlessly utilizing minor alterations to create the best film it can be believe the hype if you dont like this movie then well i guess epic scifi stories and deserts simply arent your thing fair enough but for most of us it really doesnt get any better than thisthe script is excellent this was a very hard novel to adapt and the writers have truly done a fantastic job with it changes have been made from the source material details added but essentially it captures the best themes of the book overall each change cut or addition makes for a better movie still remaining faithful to the films source material i will admit however that the dune nerd in me would have liked to see that talking baby but the way they did it was effective and probably better for the silver screen frank herbert purist might get pretty bummed over this but not i the change works well and i trust denis villeneuve with what he wanted to do in his tellingi want to point out that i was kind of surprised how terrific the acting in this film was considering the amount of vanity and celebrity the cast seems to bask in this isnt just a cast of what marilyn manson would call the beautiful people but actually a talented one timothy chalamet really brings it in the films second half he was born to play paul atreides and i would have never of known he was capable of pulling it off so well with what i have previously seen him in i loved austin butler as feydrautha but it was actually javier bardem as stilgar that i enjoyed the most his character is beautifully written in this screenplay providing smart laugh out loud comic relief but also delivering serious dramatic scenes with awesome dialogue his delivery of i dont care if you do not believe i believe which was perfectly placed in the trailer is even better in the film the man is a very good actor obviously given his track record and it was simply awesome seeing him deliver such well written dialoguethe visual fx i dont even know how to convey how great they look they simply put are stunning what a treat to see it in imax this movie truly was made for imax it looks incrediblewhich brings me to cinematography also stunning absolute perfection the lighting and color pallets my god its just stunningsound design and score are every bit as awesome as they were in the first film perfection hans zimmer is really in the prime of his career giving us stunningly original and memorable works of musicas far as memorable scenes and sequences go every single one hits pretty hard and is expertly crafted the climatic final knife fight was the best i had scene since the climatic sword fight in rob roy but i cant write this gushing review without mentioning the sandworm riding scene where paul first mounts one of these iconic beast wow this goes down as one of my favorite scenes ever in a film i practically edged myself off my seat even knowing what the outcome would be having read the book it was just wow so coolupon the movie ending my wife and i just wanted to stay in the theater and watch it over again i cant wait to see this film again and again and again i really think it is a modern classic this isnt something i say lightly the hype was real for me i hope you all feel the same as i did because both dune and dune part are some of the greatest times ive had at the movies in the past twenty years this is what large budget major studio films should be this is art on its grandest scale not just a cheap attempt to cash in on a beloved franchise its so refreshing and nice to see that hollywood still has a few quality films to make in my personal opinion timothy chalamet and zendaya earned every right to wear those ludicrous outfits on the red carpet they could have worn hot dog suits for all i care because not only did they do a fantastic job but the entire cast and crew this film helped create something people such as myself will be enjoying for a very very long time,positive
994,denis villeneuves dune part two is one of the best scifi fantasy movies to be ever producedthe adapted screenplay is almost true to its source material the spice of the book has been captured faithfully and even there are few deviations from the book i choose to believe the same would have taken to adapt the movie in best possible mannerthe soundtrack of the movie by the han zimmer elevates the mood and make each scene feel meaningful and epic the sound design complements the visual prowess perfectlydennis villeneues dune trilogy will be his magnus opus each shot has been carefully crafted to almost perfection leaving no waste behind we are truly blessed to witness his workwith an ensemble cast of industry veterans and hollywoods future biggest and brightest stars the casting of new characters can be considered as great each actoractress have done justice to their roles with standout performances by rebecca ferguson zendaya timothee and austin butlerproduction design costumes and makeup is excellenta must watch for every moviegoer experience it in imax if possible,positive
995,bottom line first this film unlike part one is less dune and more duneadjacent while the first film adhered somewhat closely to the storyline of frank herberts book this section wildly veers away from the source material it would be more accurate to say it is a film adaptation using characters and some situation from the book it also depends on spectacle rather than storytellingtimothe chalamet is again reasonably good as paul i am continually surprised and impressed by his range and abilityzendaya is also quite good sadly she is hampered by chani being written a minor secondary characterthe rest are adequatedune has a rich story with significant subtext sadly director denis villeneuve relys far too heavily on spectacle resulting in a film that is pretty but not at all important this is not unexpected he has a long history of almostgreat near misses make no mistake he is good and has awards that speak to that but he is nowhere near great and he could bethe costuming is good but the characters are continually shown wearing partial stillsuits at times they are outside without one at all no fremen in their right minds would ever do this i realize you need to show the principals faces and such but good directors and costumers would find acceptable workaroundsspecial effect are good again the concentration is on spectacleone more thing the stunt actors are brilliant the entire stunt crew deserves the greatest of praise their work alone adds a star to the film good job allas always your mileage may vary,positive
996,i cant believe my eyes what just i experienced in theatre this movie is one of the best cinematic experience ive ever had from opening scene to end credit every second is worth it epic score by hans zimmer elevates the experience filled with beautiful shots and cinematography to a great scrrenplay and some top notch acting by every cast member dune will be remembered as one of the best films of this generation even after years later thats my guarantee denis villeneuve is one of the best director of this generation who gave us masterpiece like blade runner and currently working on rd part of this trilogy which i cant wait to see action scenes were great featuring big ships blasters laser guns and every other kind of weapons sound effects were amazing but most importantly screenplay was well paced and story featuring blend of sci fi and fantasy elements is absolute best of the best even though it is an adaptation of novel of same name it is one of the best adaptations ever i loved both movies and cant wait to see what happens in future because i enjoy films about the chosen one prophecy like star wars the matrix and now this i wont give any spoiler here and will not talk about anything shown in the movie since you need to see this movie for yourself to feel the magic dont miss it at any cost watch it on the biggest screen possible especially imax to enjoy epic sound effects and see the larger than life picture youll love it,positive

998,i just dont understand the high scoring for this movie long drawn out scenes with constant accompanying noise its not back ground music its continuous noise similar to a fog horn the time of this movie could be halved if they removed most of the artistic licenseoverall though its boring really really dullid love to leave it at that but there is a requirement for minimum word count so to make the review more interesting ill tell you about the weather in inverness today its a strong to gale force westerly with intermittent showers of rain and hail i wish all reading this a good day,positive
999,a very very good moviethe story picks up basically right after the first movie as the plot gets deeper and deeper throughout the movie i will give a general gistpaul is battling the fact he is the prophecy while his mother goes above and beyond to prove it chani and paul grow closer over his time becoming a fremen as she vows to stick with him as he remains who he isbeast is struggling with the fremen attacks to stop the spice harvesting his brother feyd is brought in as he is a psychopath and they need someone crazy to eliminate the threatthe whole movie is a religious and power struggle battle the north and south in contrast while they all seek a leader its a very strong movie in that sensethe acting is top notch from everyone timothee really has his movie the second half he shows his chops and wow one of his strongest performances in my opinionits hard to pick out others as they are all so strong his mother plays a vicious role superbly austin butler is great as a crazed killer power hungry lunatic all greatthe score and visuals go without saying cinema experience needed for this onei gave the first a lower score it wasnt for me but this was great,positive
1000,dune part two is intelligent blockbuster filmmaking at its finest an epic tragedy told on the biggest canvas imaginable with every department operating in unison and at the top of their game the first dune may have focused on the setup but that doesnt mean this one is rushing straight into the action maintaining that immersive slow burning naturetimothe chalamet got a nice journey in the original however this one is so much bigger he plays the internal conflict so well as he tries his best to avoid his destiny and by the end he feels like a different person entirely in a way that doesnt come out of nowhere in those earlier moments he also displays palpable chemistry with zendaya as they begin to truly connectas well as having that strong chemistry with chalamet zendaya is given so much more to do here as promised essentially becoming colead as the film descends further in its climactic moments she remains the only one whos able to see through the manipulation thats happening with a fair few moments where her looks of frustration say everythingthere are so many huge names in this cast that dont get much in an impactful way all of them are fully committed to their smaller parts with austin butler being a major highlight the film describes him as psychotic and honestly thats putting it mildly his deliberate impersonation of the baron really works to make him even more unsettlingits clear from its first major action sequence bathed in a beautiful orange hue that director denis villeneuve is a master of the craft at this point even compared to part one the scale of this chapter is immense with returning cinematographer greig fraser bringing his specific set of skills to make this an undeniable cinematic eventconsidering how good his previous score was hans zimmer couldve easily coasted for this one by just reusing all of those themes but its obvious that he wouldnt do that because he clearly loves playing in this sandbox almost every transcendent piece from last time is still present and theres new ones that are equally memorable,positive
